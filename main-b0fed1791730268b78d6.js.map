Babel.<a id=\\\"javascript-babel-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p>JavaScript má oproti většině ostatních jazyků jedno specifikum. Je sám o sobě poměrně <strong>nepoužitelný</strong>. Na vině je především způsob, jakým dochází k uvádění jeho nových verzí. Jak si s tím úspěšně a elegantně poradit?</p>\\n<h2>JavaScript vs ECMAScript<a id=\\\"javascript-vs-ecmascript\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>JavaScript je pouze jednou z implementací standardu jménem <strong>ECMAScript</strong>. Díky obrovské popularitě JavaScriptu se ovšem tyto dva termíny často libovolně zaměňují. Existují však ještě další implementace jako JScript či ActionScript.</p>\\n<p>Ecma International od roku 1997 postupně vydává jednotlivé specifikace. Poslední stabilní verze je <strong><a href=\\\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?id=start&amp;cache=cache&amp;media=resources:es5_errata_7-31-10.pdf\\\">5.1 z roku 2011</a></strong>. Letos v létě pak přijde nová edice s pořadovým číslem 6 označovaná také kódem <strong>ES6</strong> či <strong>Harmony</strong>. K dispozici je už <a href=\\\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?id=harmony%3Aspecification_drafts&amp;cache=cache&amp;media=harmony:ecma-262_6th_edition_final_draft_-04-14-15.pdf\\\">finální draft</a>. Zároveň se nám rodí i verze číslo 7.</p>\\n<h2>Podpora prohlížečů<a id=\\\"podpora-prohl-e-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Asi vás nepřekvapí, že několik let stará specifikace 5.1 je dnes plně podporovaná napříč všemi prohlížeči. Co vás ovšem možná zaskočí je fakt, že výrobci prohlížečů <strong>nečekají s implementací</strong> nových specifikací na stabilní verze a tak už dnes například <strong>Chrome podporuje 45% funkcí Harmony</strong>, Firefox 69%, Internet Explorer 16%, Spartan 73% a Safari 20%. Aby toho nebylo málo, tak se v prohlížečích začínají objevovat i funkce z ECMAScriptu 7 a to navzdory tomu, že jsou teprve ve stádiu raného návrhu. Poměrně <strong>slušná anarchie</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Co s tím?<a id=\\\"co-s-t-m-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>My, tvůrci webových aplikací, musíme zajistit, aby naše stránky správně fungovaly ve všech běžně používaných prohlížečích. Jak si ale poradit s tím, že každý prohlížeč podporuje jiný set standardu Harmony? Nejjednodušším řešením je se zatím 6. verzi zcela vyhnout a <strong>používat pouze funkce z verze 5.1</strong>, která je již plně etablovaná. Nicméně tím se ocitnete v pozici malého dítěte, které v hračkárně toužebně pokukuje po mluvících a chodících robůtcích, zatímco doma si ještě několik let bude muset hrát s klacky a kameny. Předchozí příklad je samozřejmě nadsázka. Tak propastný rozdíl mezi verzemi zase není. Nicméně nebojte, existují lepší řešení.</p>\\n<h2>Shimujeme<a id=\\\"shimujeme\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>ES6 přináší dva typy novinek. Tou první jsou <strong>nové objekty a funkce</strong> na již existujících objektech. K těm si můžeme dopomoci jednoduše tím, že k projektu připojíme kusy kódu nazývané <a href=\\\"https://github.com/es-shims\\\">shimy a polyfilly</a>. Ty pak detekují chybějící či odlišné API jednotlivých prohlížečů a následně je doplní a sjednotí. V budoucnu, až budou prohlížeče daný standard plně podporovat, můžeme tyto knihovny úplně odstranit.</p>\\n<h2>Kompilujeme<a id=\\\"kompilujeme\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Druhou novinkou je nová syntax. V ES6 nám například přibyla nová klíčová slova jako <code>class</code>, <code>extends</code>, <code>let</code> či <code>import</code>. Tady si bohužel pouze s připojenou knihovnou už nevystačíme. Musíme použít <strong>program - kompilátor</strong>, který náš kód přeloží do starší plně podporované verze. V našem případě ES5. Navíc vyřeší i ony nové objekty a funkce z předchozí kapitoly (někdy ale bude i tak potřeba přidat polyfill). I zde platí, že v budoucnu budeme moct kompilátor z procesu úplně vynechat a náš kód bude v prohlížečích fungovat bez dodatečných úprav.</p>\\n<h2>V budoucnu?<a id=\\\"v-budoucnu-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Problém ovšem je, že jakmile budou prohlížeče plně podporovat ES6, tak tu budeme mít finální specifikaci ES7 a mlsně pokukovat po ES8. Prakticky to znamená jediné. <strong>Samotný JavaScript nikdy používat nemůžeme</strong>, pokud nechceme být neustále 4 roky pozadu. Nejlepším řešením je tedy vždy používat jazyk kompilovaný do JavaScriptu.</p>\\n<h2>Kompilátory<a id=\\\"kompil-tory\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Nových jazyků a kompilátorů existuje celá řada. Dají se rozdělit do 2 základních kategorií. Tou první jsou zcela nové jazyky, které mají úplně odlišnou syntax a nemůžeme je tedy použít na vylepšení již hotových projektů. Jde například o populární <a href=\\\"http://coffeescript.org\\\">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.purescript.org\\\">PureScript</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript\\\">ClojureScript</a> či <a href=\\\"https://www.dartlang.org\\\">Dart</a> (ten se snažil dokonce úplně emancipovat od JS ale neúspěšně). Druhou kategorií jsou jazyky, které současný JavaScript pouze rozšiřují a snaží se více či méně zachovat dopřednou kompatibilitu. Jde třeba o <a href=\\\"http://www.typescriptlang.org\\\">TypeScript</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler\\\">Traceur</a> či <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io\\\">Babel</a>. Vzájemným porovnáváním by se dalo popsat několik dalších stránek, proto ho nechávám na každém z vás. Dále se budu věnovat pouze poslednímu jmenovanému.</p>\\n<h2>Babel<a id=\\\"babel\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Babel nedávno vznikl přejmenováním z <strong>6to5</strong>, rychle se dostal na špičku popularity a získává stále větší momentum. <strong>Proč je úspěšný?</strong> Hlavním důvodem je jednoduše <a href=\\\"https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/\\\">nejširší podpora ES6 (77%) i ES7 (61%)</a>. Plně integruje <strong>JSX a React</strong> (taková ta podivnost, kdy píšete HTML tagy přímo do těla JavaScriptových funkcí). Skvěle si rozumí s editory a různými nástroji.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width:250px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + __webpack_require__(112) + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Babel - nová generace JavaScriptu\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Používají ho už dnes firmy jako <strong>Facebook, Yahoo, Netflix, Mozilla a Evernote</strong>. Můžete ho nasadit na serverovém prostředí <strong>node.js</strong>. Je to ale stále onen čistý JavaScript, takže s ním můžete bez problémů zkompilovat i svoje stávající projekty a s ES6 začít postupně.</p>\\n<h2>Co tedy ES6 přináší?<a id=\\\"co-tedy-es6-p-in-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Je toho spousta.

Velké firmy do něj investují nemálo peněz a jeho vývoj tak probíhá překotným tempem. Díky tomu pak vznikají špičkové nástroje jako je Babel. To co na první pohled vypadá jako divoká džungle, tak nakonec příspívá k pružnějšímu vývoji, nutí výrobce prohlížečů rychleji implementovat nové funkce a programátor tím přesto nemusí trpět. Co si tedy z článku odnést? Jednoduché ponaučení! Vždy si přidejte Babel do svého vývojářského procesu a užívejte si budoucnost už dnes. <strong>JavaScript je mrtev, ať žije Babel!</strong></p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ },\n/* 127 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"<h1>Nástroje<a id=\\\"n-stroje\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p>Tak jako truhlář potřebuje hoblík, pilu nebo nebozez, tak i <strong>vývojář webovek se neobejde bez pořádných nástrojů</strong>. Když si vyberete ty správné a naučíte se s nimi pořádně zacházet, značně usnadní a zrychlí vaši práci. V tomto článku se s nimi v rychlosti seznámíme.</p>\\n<h2>Operační systém<a id=\\\"opera-n-syst-m\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Vezmeme to pěkně od základu a tím je operační systém. Nemá smysl chodit kolem horké kaše. Sami asi tušíte, že tím <strong>slonem v místnosti je Windows</strong>. Budete s ním pravděpodobně narážet na různé problémy (pramenící z node.js, npm, slabší podpory Facebooku v jeho opensource knihovnách...), které byste na OSX nebo Linuxu nikdy řešit nemuseli. Předem se tak omlouvám, pokud vám občas něco nebude fungovat. <strong>Články totiž primárně počítají s OSX (či Linuxem)</strong>. Budu ovšem moc rád, pokud případné opravy či návody pošlete pull requestem.</p>\\n<h2>Prohlížeč<a id=\\\"prohl-e-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Standardem pro vývoj je Google Chrome</strong>, který má dnes asi nejpropracovanější vývojářské nástroje. Otevřete je zkratkou <code>⌘</code>+<code>alt</code>+<code>j</code>. <strong>Vůbec nejdůležitějším panelem je <code>Console</code></strong>. Mějte ho pořád na očích. JavaScript vám do něj bude vypisovat všechny warningy a errory. Také si do něj můžete logovat hodnoty vlastní pomocí funkce <code>console.log(...)</code>, která přehledně vypíše i komplikované datové struktury, což je fajn pro rychlé ladění.</p>\\n<p>Druhým nejužitečnějším panelem je <code>Elements</code>. <strong>Můžete v něm procházet a hlavně upravovat aktuální DOM strukturu a kaskádové styly.</strong> Změny se pak okamžitě projeví v okně prohlížeče. Hodí se třeba i pro ujištění, zda vám JavaScript vyrendroval nějakou komponentu a není třeba jen schovaná kvůli špatnému stylování.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + __webpack_require__(114) + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Chrome s otevřenou konzolí\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Další panely už budete používat asi méně. Velmi šikovný je <code>Network</code>, ve kterém si můžete přehledně například vyfiltrovat XHR requesty. V <code>Sources</code> pak můžete debugovat pomocí breakpointů. Doinstalovat si můžete i speciální <a href=\\\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en\\\">panel pro React</a>. Je podobný <code>Elements</code>, ale poskytuje i informace o stavu React komponent. Nicméně reálně ho moc nepoužívám.</p>\\n<p>V nastavení vývojářských nástroju si ještě zkontrolujte, že máte zaškrtnuté <code>Enable CSS source maps</code> a <code>Enable JavaScript source maps</code>. V našich projektech nebudeme používat přímo JavaScript, ale Babel, který se do něho překládá. <strong>Source mapa pak umožní prohlížeči namapovat řádky výsledného JavaScriptu na zdrojový Babel</strong> a my se tak dozvíme správný řádek a soubor, kde došlo k chybě. Obdobně to funguje pro CSS a preprocesory jako je LESS.</p>\\n<p>Web nakonec musíte samozřejmě pravidelně testovat i v ostatních prohlížečích. I ty mají vlastní vývojařské nástroje. Pokud se vám tedy stane, že vám něco nefunguje pouze ve Firefoxu, nebojte se je vyzkoušet. Jsou velmi podobné těm v Chromu.</p>\\n<h2>Sublime Text<a id=\\\"sublime-text\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Zatímco mezi webovými prohlížeči moc na výběr nemáte, <strong>o dobré textové editory není nouze</strong>. Nemá smysl zde dělat nějaké dogmatické závěry. Někomu bude vyhovovat spartánský VIM a někdo má zase rád velké všeobjímající IDE. I tak se mezi JavaScriptovými vývojáři dá vypozorovat několik oblíbenců. <strong>Jedním z nich je editor <a href=\\\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\\\">Sublime Text</a>.</strong> Momentálně ho používám jako svůj hlavní editor pro všechno.</p>\\n<p>Jeho největší předností je rychlost, jednoduchost, spolehlivost a obrovská paleta všemožných doplňků. Nevýhodou pak je to, že se jedná o one-man show projekt, který autor trochu zanedbává, nicméně nedávno se mu zas začal věnovat. Jak už to bývá, dobré věci nejsou zadarmo a tak vás licence vyjde na rozumných $70. Lze ho však nějaký čas používat a zkoušet zdarma. Nejvíce ho totiž oceníte až po nějaké době, kdy si zapamatujete různé zkratky a využijete tak jeho maximální potenciál.</p>\\n<p>Pokud se ho rozhodnete používat pro vývoj webovek, doporučuji si pro začátek <a href=\\\"https://packagecontrol.io/installation\\\">stáhnout a nainstalovat</a> tyto doplňky:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/alienhard/SublimeAllAutocomplete\\\">All Autocomplete</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/BoundInCode/AutoFileName\\\">AutoFileName</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime\\\">Babel</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime\\\">EditorConfig</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/miguelgraz/FocusFileOnSidebar\\\">Focus File On Sidebar</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git\\\">Git</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements\\\">Sidebar Enhancements</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3\\\">Sublime Linter</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>V některém z dalším článku popíšu, jak a proč si nastavit ESLint neboli kontrolu kódu pro JavaScript (Babel) a JSX přímo v Sublime Textu.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + __webpack_require__(116) + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Sublime Text 3\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Dalším editorem, který stojí za pozornost je <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/\\\">Atom</a></strong>. Je to open source projekt, za kterým stojí GitHub a velmi připomíná Sublime Text. Má ale jeden problém a to je stabilita. Není zatím tak &quot;uhlazený&quot; jako ST a to je u nástroje, který používáte prakticky pořád, dost nepříjemné. Čas od času ho i přesto zkouším a jsou tam vidět velké pokroky. Také nad ním vznikají nové nástavby jako je <a href=\\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\\\">Visual Studio Code</a> od Microsoftu nebo <a href=\\\"http://nuclide.io/\\\">Nuclide</a> od Facebooku. Budoucnost Atomu vypadá zajímavě.</p>\\n<p>Hodně přívrženců pak má i <a href=\\\"https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/\\\">WebStorm</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/\\\">PHPStorm</a> a celá rodina editorů postavená nad IntelliJ. <strong>Pokud máte rádi velké plnohodnotné IDE, které už v základu lecos umí, tak rozhodně stojí za zkoušku</strong>. Na psaní kódu se dá ale používat prakticky cokoliv, takže se nebojte experimentovat.</p>\\n<h2>Terminál<a id=\\\"termin-l\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Svatou trojici pak uzavírá terminál. <strong>Prohlížeč, textový editor a terminál jsou tři věci, které musíte mít jako vývojář stále na očích</strong>. Kromě základní práce se soubory a Gitem z něho budete spouštět vývojový server, buildovat produkční verze a sledovat případné warningy a errory v kódu. Obzvlášť s používáním hot reloadu se většina hlášení bude objevovat právě zde a nikoliv v Console logu prohlížeče.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + __webpack_require__(117) + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"OSX Terminal\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Node.js a Npm<a id=\\\"node-js-a-npm\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>O <a href=\\\"https://nodejs.org/\\\">node.js</a> jste už určitě všichni slyšeli. Jistého chytrého člověka napadlo vzít JavaScript runtime z Chromu a postavit nad ním velmi výkonnou platformu, která by se dala používat i mimo prohlížeč a to zejména na serverech. Tento nápad se setkal s obrovským ohlasem a pomohl odstartovat to pravé JavaScriptové šílenství.</p>\\n<p>Asi není překvapivé, že <strong>node se tak stává přirozenou volbou (nejen) pro aplikace, které závisí na velkém JS frontendu</strong>. Je totiž velmi výhodné používat stejný jazyk na obou březích. Můžete tak snadno sdílet části kódu (například validační pravidla či routing), či si předrendrovat stránku už na serveru a uživateli poslat rovnou hotové HTML. Navíc i pokud se rozhodnete stavět server nad jinou platformou, tak se nodu nevyhnete kvůli vývojářským nástrojům, které jsou téměř výhradně napsané také v JavaScriptu. <strong>Takže si ho prosím rovnou nainstalujte</strong>.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 300px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + __webpack_require__(115) + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"NPM logo\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>S nodem se vám nainstaluje i <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/\\\">npm</a> - balíčkovací manager</strong>. Jde o ultimátní a jednotné řešení pro sdílení kódů napříč JS ekosystémem. Původně byl určen pro prostředí nodu, ale nakonec se z něj stal i jednotný systém pro frontend vývojáře (R.I.P <a href=\\\"http://bower.io/\\\">bower</a>). Používá ho tak node, browserify, webpack, gulp, grunt, Angular, jQuery, React, prohlížeče ... prostě všichni.</p>\\n<p><strong>Největší předností a odlišností NPM (například od Boweru) je to, že každý balíček může mít své vlastní závislosti (balíčky)</strong>. Vzniká tak strom závislostí a není problém, aby v jednom projektu běžela jedna knihovna v několika verzích. Tedy, občas to problém být může. Například React bude dost nešťastný, pokud bude muset o správu DOMu bojovat s další instancí Reactu. Aneb vůči dependency hellu není a nebude zcela imunní žádný balíčkovací manager, ale NPM si v porovnání s konkurencí vede víc než obstojně. <strong>Dalším fundamentálním rysem je filosofie malých a jednoúčelových balíčků</strong>. Není tedy nic zvláštního, pokud je balíček pouze jedna několikařádková funkce.</p>\\n<h2>Grunt<a id=\\\"grunt\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Se vší tou záplavou růných nástrojů, kompilátorů a linterů je potřeba se nějak vypořádat</strong>. Představte si, že byste po každé změně kódu museli vlézt do terminálu, najít změněný soubor, spustit nad ním Babel, poté ESLint a pak v prohlížeči ještě udělat refresh. To je přeci repetativní úkon, který se může zautomatizovat. <strong>Objevily se tak nástroje označované jako &quot;task runnery&quot;</strong>. Velmi populárním byl (a stále je?) <a href=\\\"http://gruntjs.com/\\\">Grunt</a>. Do projektu si přidáte <code>Gruntfile</code>, ve kterém si vše můžete nakonfigurovat. Konfigurace se skládá z jednotlivých tasků, které můžete pak volat v různém pořadí. Jednotlivé tasky (moduly) nemusíte psát sami, ale většinou je už najdete hotové na NPM. Jsou jich tisíce. Výsledek může vypadat třeba takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">module<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>grunt<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n\\n  grunt<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >initConfig<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    jshint<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n      files<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'Gruntfile.js'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> 'src<span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/**/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >*</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>js<span class=\\\"token string\\\" >', '</span>test<span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/**/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >*</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>js'<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n      options<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n        globals<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n          jQuery<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token primitive\\\" >true</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    watch<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n      files<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'&lt;%= jshint.files %>'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n      tasks<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'jshint'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >]</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n  grunt<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >loadNpmTasks<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'grunt-contrib-jshint'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  grunt<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >loadNpmTasks<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'grunt-contrib-watch'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n  grunt<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >registerTask<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'default'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'jshint'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p><strong>Postupně se však ukázalo, že cesta &quot;vše konfigurovat&quot; není úplně nejšťastnější</strong>. Bez dokumentace totiž nedáte ani ránu a pokud si nevystačíte s předem danými funkcemi, tak máte problém. <strong>Dalším problémem Gruntu je rychlost</strong>. Mezivýsledky si totiž ukládá do filesystému a u větších projektů s komplikovaným build procesem trvá dlouho (tohle už možná nejnovější verze nějak řeší).</p>\\n<h2>Gulp<a id=\\\"gulp\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>A tak přibyl mladší bráška <a href=\\\"http://gulpjs.com/\\\">Gulp</a>, který se ponaučil z Gruntu a jde na to lépe</strong>. Konfigurace aka <code>Gulpfile</code> je JavaScript. <strong>Místo toho, abyste konfigurovali, tak programujete</strong>, což je velmi flexibilní a také odpadá nutnost spoléhat na dokumentace. Dalším zlepšovákem jsou streamy, které Gulp používá. Mezivýsledky si drží v paměti, vše běží paralelně a především citelně rychleji. Občas je však problém zkrotit tasky tak, aby běžely sekvenčně (verze 4.x tento častý problém adresuje). Tak jako Grunt i Gulp má dnes již téměř nekonečné množství pluginů. <strong>Grunt vs Gulp? Rozhodně Gulp</strong>.

Takový modulární systém potřebuje dvě primární věci: možnost exportovat a importovat. Výše jste si mohli již povšimnout importování:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> gulp <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >require<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'gulp'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p>Obdobný zápis v ES6:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> gulp from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'gulp'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p>Výše uvedené zkusí prohledat <code>/node_modules</code> ve vašem projektu - místo, kam se vám budou ukládat balíčky z npm. Stačí zavolat <code>npm install gulp --save</code> a máte ho tam. Přepínač <code>--save</code> ho navíc přidá do seznamu v <code>package.json</code>. Běžně se totiž <code>/node_modules</code> adresář v Gitu ignoruje a tak je někde potřeba uchovávat seznam všech závislostí.</p>\\n<p>V <code>/node_modules/gulp</code> se pak import podívá do hlavního souboru daného balíčku a v něm najde export:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> inst <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >Gulp</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\nmodule<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> inst<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p><strong>To je vše pěkné, ale asi vás teď napadlo, jak to bude fungovat v prohlížeči? Nebude.</strong> Do prohlížeče můžeme jednotlivé skripty nahrávat pomocí <code>&lt;script&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt;</code>, ale to nám moc nepomůže. Podobných souborů totiž budeme mít v projektu stovky až tisíce a posílat tolik HTTP requestů rozhodně nemůžeme. <strong>Také to nijak neřeší potřebu verzování, minimalizování a zapouzdřování</strong>. Tyto závislosti je tedy potřeba vyřešit už před releasem a uživateli posílat jeden výsledný soubor, ve kterém bude jen to, co skutečně potřebuje.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 250px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + __webpack_require__(113) + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Magické Browserify\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>A tak vzniklo <a href=\\\"http://browserify.org/\\\">Browserify</a></strong>.

Poradí si například i s core node.js knihovnami. Nicméně to má samozřejmě jistá omezení. Například nemůžete pracovat s <code>fs</code> (filesystem). Velkým plusem je, že není potřeba nic konfigurovat - jednoduše to bude fungovat. Všechna magie se děje uvnitř. Ne nadarmo má ve znaku kouzelnický klobouk.</p>\\n<h2>Webpack<a id=\\\"webpack\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Browserify funguje opravdu pěkně, ale i tak má přeci jen pár mušek</strong>. Řeší totiž jenom JavaScript a vše ostatní je potřeba doplnit spoustou gulp modulů. Navíc se ukázalo, že <strong>kromě JavaScriptu je potřeba podobně zpracovat i CSS</strong> (v praxi například LESS) nebo obrázky. To by nemuselo s Gulpem a jeho tisíci pluginy vadit, že? Bohužel Gulp má jednu zásadní slabinu, která plyne ze streamování. Neumí úplně přímočaře vytvořit z několika souborů jeden výstupní (s tím se umí lépe vypořádat např. undergroundovější task runner <a href=\\\"http://broccolijs.com/\\\">Broccoli</a>). Je tak potřeba v gulp tascích řešit trochu nešikovně bundlování. A z toho zase mohou vznikat další obtíže, jako je správné odchytávání a zobrazování chyb. Dá se s tím poprat, ale budete cítit, že to není úplně ono.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/\\\">Webpack</a> na to jde úplně jinak, tak trochu proti filosofii celého JS ekosystému</strong>. Nedeleguje a nevyčleňuje jednotlivé funkce do více modulů a tak už v základu představuje velmi mocný nástroj. Nástroj, který byl od počátku zamýšlen tak, aby nám vývojářům co nejvíce usnadnil práci. <strong>Základním stavebním kamenem jsou loadery</strong>. Každý formát má vlastní a může jít téměř o cokoliv (.js, .css, .less, .coffee, .png...). Webpack pak přetíží <code>require()</code> volání a můžete ho použít třeba i pro markdown dokumenty (jako tato stránka). Následně pak funguje podobně jako browserify, tedy vyřeší závislosti a sestaví build, ve kterém je jen to potřebné.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + __webpack_require__(118) + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Webpack proces\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Oproti browserify je potřeba ho nakonfigurovat, což není úplně jednoduché</strong>. Na druhou stranu, jakmile to jednou uděláte, získáte velmi mocného společníka. Konfiguraci navíc můžete z velké části obšlehnout. <strong>Poskytuje také jednu killer funkci</strong>, kterou browserify nemá a pro kterou se vyplatí na něj z browserify přejít a tím je <strong>hot module replacement</strong>. Dokáže nahradit a zpracovat modul, aniž by bylo potřeba refreshovat celou stránku (a modul může být javascript, less nebo markdown!). Bez jakýchkoliv dodatečných pluginů v prohlížeči. Pouze čistý JavaScript! To ohromně zefektivňuje vývoj.</p>\\n<p>Dobré je také zmínit, že <strong>kdykoliv můžete velmi snadno přejít z browserify na webpack</strong> (bez úprav zdrojáků). Udělal jsem to nedávno u projektu s 10 000 řádky kódu a 70 npm moduly bez jediné upravy mimo konfiguraci webpacku a gulpu. Naopak už to vždy jít nemusí (pokud například budete specifikovat loadery inline přímo v require voláních).</p>\\n<h2>ESLint<a id=\\\"eslint\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Lintování je levný způsob, jak zlepšit stav zdrojáků napříč větším projektem či týmem několika programátorů</strong>. Hlídá totiž styl, jakým kód píšete a tak musí všichni stejně odsazovovat nebo používat závorky. <strong>Pravidla, podle kterých se řídí, si samozřejmě můžete libovolně nastavit</strong>. Nebude vám podstrkovat nějaký svůj styl. Krom toho, že hlídá úhlednost a jednotnost kódu, tak vám leckdy pomůže odhalit i různé překlepy či nepoužíváné importy. <a href=\\\"http://eslint.org/\\\">ESLint</a> je poměrně nový JS linter (2013), který si vzal ponaučení z JSHintu a je kompletně modulární. Můžete si do něj tedy přidávat různé doplňky. <strong>Například se vám bude jistě hodit podpora React JSX či Babelu</strong>. Lintování si můžete nainstalovat přímo do svého editoru a zároveň ho přidat i do build procesu, což je taková případná obrana před vývojářem, který by se rozhodl pravidla porušit.</p>\\n<h2>Závěrem<a id=\\\"z-v-rem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Tento článek byl především seznamovací a většina z vás v něm asi nenalezla mnoho nového. I tak je ale důležité udělat alespoň rychlý přehled o různých nástrojích a technologiích, které se dnes používají. <strong>V JS světě se budete neustále potýkat s tím, že žádná řešení nejsou ultimátní</strong> a i ta, která jsou zrovna na špici, mohou za půl roku upadnout zcela v zapomnění. A tak tu máme několik kvalitních prohlížečů, editorů, task runnerů, bundlerů, linterů a dokonce i &quot;JavaScript jazyků&quot;.</p>\\n<p>Ale nebojte, příště už to bude rozhodně zajímavější! Vyhrneme si rukávy a pustíme se konečně do práce. <strong>Ukážeme si, jak to vše poskládat dohromady a napíšeme si první React komponentu!</strong></p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ },\n/* 128 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"<h1>React - JSX<a id=\\\"react-jsx\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p>První věc, která nováčka v Reactu rozhodně praští do očí, je zápis XML (HTML) tagů přímo do JavaScriptového kódu bez apostrofů kolem. Takovýto zápis se ve světě Reactu nazývá JSX a ano, není to validní JS syntax. Před spuštěním se musí do JS kompilovat. <strong>Dnes si ukážeme, co je pod pokličkou JSX a že se vlastně není čeho bát</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Šablonovací systémy<a id=\\\"-ablonovac-syst-my\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Pojem &quot;šablonovací systém&quot; vám asi není neznámý. V oblasti webů má za úkol oddělit kód (např. PHP) od popisu struktury stránky. Známé příklady jsou Latte, Smarty nebo Twig. Ve světě JavaScriptu pak <a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/\\\">Closure Templates (Soy)</a>. Šablony obsahují jeden velký řetězec plný HTML, CSS a JS + nějaké speciální zápisy (proměnné, makra...). Šablonovací systém pak pomocí regulárních výrazů naplní šablonu daty a poslepuje z ní výsledný řetězec, který může poslat do prohlížeče. Skutečný proces může být i o něco složitější, ale princip zůstává stejný - <strong>jde o slepování řetězců</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>DOM vs řetězce<a id=\\\"dom-vs-et-zce\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Slepování řetězců funguje dobře na straně serveru, protože s reloadem celé stránky odpadá starost o stav stránky (například co bylo vyplněné ve formuláři) a vše se načte a spustí znova. <strong>Jenže co dělat, když chceme chceme aktualizovat jenom malé výseky stránky pomocí DOMu?</strong> Můžeme nad upravovaným DOM elementem zavolat:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Element</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>innerHTML <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'&lt;div>Komponenta, kterou jsme aktualizovali&lt;/div>'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p>Problém vyřešen. Naše šablony (řetězce) můžeme takto vložit na libovolné místo DOMu a navíc je to ještě velmi rychlé. Má to ale zásadní háček.</p>\\n<p><strong>Pokud by naše komponenta měla na sobě pověšené listenery (například onClick), tak ty po innerHTML zmizí a musíme je opětovně navěsit.</strong> Co když bude v naší komponentě formulář a uživatel v něm bude mít zrovna něco rozepsané? Všechno mu během aktualizace zmizí. Aktualizování DOMu pomocí innerHTML je sice velmi rychlé, ale také velmi náchylné k chybám. Navíc si to přímo říká o XSS .</p>\\n<p>A tak vývojáři raději mění DOM postupně pomocí bezpečnějších metod typu <code>Node.appendChild()</code> či <code>Node.replaceChild()</code>. Problém vyřešen? Ne tak docela. Pěkné řetězcové šablony, kde na první pohled vidíme strukturu komponent, už nám najednou nestačí a naše zdrojáky musíme doplnit o různě dlouhé série <code>Node</code> metod, což je typické imperativní nepřehledné programování. <strong>Místo toho, abychom definovali jednotlivé stavy (podoby) našich komponent, musíme dávat dohromady sady kroků, kterými se z jednoho stavu dostaneme do druhého.</strong> Kdyby tak byla nějaká knihovna, která by tohle za nás vyřešila. Třeba React, že.</p>\\n<h2>Funkce místo řetězců<a id=\\\"funkce-m-sto-et-zc-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Definice komponent pomocí řetězců má tedy své limity. React však používá silnější nástroj - virtuální DOM (strom), který si vytvoří na základě <strong><code>render()</code> metod, které popisují strukturu komponent pomocí funkcí</strong>. Tento virtuální DOM se spak pomocí <code>appendChild</code> či <code>innerHTML</code> promítne do DOMu skutečného a dojde tak k překreslení v prohlížeči. Pokud se u některé komponenty změní props nebo state, opětovně se zavolá metoda <code>render()</code>, vznikne nový virtuální DOM, porovná se s tím s předchozím a rozdíly mezi němi se nejefektivnějším možným způsobem promítnou opět i do DOMu skutečného.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jak se ale HTML dá převést na funkce?</strong> Názvy jednotlivých elementů nahradíme za názvy funkcí a z atributů (props) uděláme jeden velký argument - mapu. Vnořené elementy (děti) pak budou představovat další argumenty (mimochodem v React komponentě jsou přístupné pomocí <code>this.props.children</code>).</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>form className<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"nameForm\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>input type<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"text\\\"</span> placeholder<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"Jméno\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>input type<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"text\\\"</span> placeholder<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"Příjmení\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>input type<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"submit\\\"</span> value<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"Poslat\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>form<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span></code><p>se zapíše jako:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >form<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>className<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'nameForm'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >input<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>type<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'text'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> placeholder<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'Jméno'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >input<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>type<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'text'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> placeholder<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'Příjmení'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >input<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>type<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'submit'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> value<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'Poslat'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span></code><p><strong>A to je celá věda kolem JSX.

Pokud jste stále trochu zmatení, zkuste si napsat pár komponent. Uvidíte, že z JSX se stane &quot;jazyk&quot;, který plně ovládnete během jednoho večera, protože si vždy velmi lehce můžete vydedukovat do čeho se kompiluje.</p>\\n<h2>Pár dalších věcí...<a id=\\\"p-r-dal-ch-v-c-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Najde se ale i pár dalších detailů, které stojí za zmínku. Občas se může stát, že <strong>chcete, aby nějaký váš vlastní atribut prošel až do výsledného DOM elementu:</strong></p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div my<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>attr<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"test\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span></code><p>Ovšem React neznámé atributy automaticky odstraní. Výjimku udělá, pokud použijete prefix <code>data-</code>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div data<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>attr<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"test\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span></code><p>Občas také můžete mít potřebu vložit někam &quot;natvrdo&quot; statický HTML kód, to se udělá takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div dangerouslySetInnerHTML<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>__html<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'&lt;b>Tohle se neescapuje!&lt;/b>'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span></code><p>Z názvu je už zřejmé, že jde o velmi nebezpečný postup, protože escapování zůstává jen a pouze na vás. Tímto úplně vyřadíte React a obsah se do stránky vloží pomocí <code>innerHTML</code>.</p>\\n<h2>Chyby<a id=\\\"chyby\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Jednou z velkých výhod definování pomocí funkcí je to, že <strong>pokud uděláte chybu, dostane se vám vždy pěkné a přesné zprávy</strong>, protože jste udělali chybu v JavaScriptovém kódu a nikoliv v nějakém řetězci, který se bude parsovat až buhví kdy.</p>\\n<p>Například chybějící uzavírací závorka:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div className<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"timeago\\\"</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Time</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Ago</span> date<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>article<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>date<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> formatter<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>formatter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span></code><p>okamžitě vypíše tuto pěknou chybu v terminálu:</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + __webpack_require__(119) + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Pěkné a přehledné chybové hlášení\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>To je luxus, který se vám většinou při &quot;slepování řetězců&quot; nedostane.</p>\\n<p>Některé atributy se jmenují jinak kvůli kolizím s klíčovými slovy. Například toto nebude fungovat:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >class</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"fooClass\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span></code><p>ale nebojte, dostane se vám ihned nápověda v konzoli:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Warning</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Unknown</span> DOM property <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >class</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Did</span> you mean className<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >?</span></code><h2>Závěrem<a id=\\\"z-v-rem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>JSX pouze zpříjemňuje čitelnost komponent.</strong> Bude se líbit zejména kodérům. React však můžete plnohodnotně používat i zcela bez něj. <strong>Důležité je však to, co se skrývá pod ním - funkce.</strong> Funkce totiž poskytují skvělou a netušeně mocnou abstrakci pro skládání jednotlivých komponent. I po 2 letech od uvedení Reactu se tak stále objevují nové a lepší způsoby, jakými do sebe jednotlivé komponenty skládat, což si určitě ukážeme i v dalších dílech. To by nebylo možné, pokud by React a JSX nebyly pouze čistým JavaScriptem. Příště si ukážeme knihovnu <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/\\\">Immutable.js</a> a způsob jak díky ní 100x zrychlit už tak rychlou React aplikaci.</p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ },\n/* 129 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"<h1>React - Props vs State<a id=\\\"react-props-vs-state\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p><strong>React se točí kolem props a tak je nejvyšší čas si ukázat, co jsou zač</strong>. Minule jsem už naznačil, že jde o druhý zdroj dat, který React komponenty pro své vykreslení používají. Povíme si, jak se props liší od state a jakým způsobem se používají. To vše si demonstrujeme na pokročilejším příkladě, který se bude skládat z více komponent. Na nich uvidíte i to, jakým způsobem se komponenty do sebe skládají a jak spolu komunikují. <strong>Dnes to bude o úplných základech Reactu</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Props<a id=\\\"props\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>React komponenty lze do sebe skládat</strong> a proto je potřeba, aby měly prostředek pro předávání dat.

Ta tímto získala přístup k <code>this.props.name</code> a <code>this.props.type</code>. Její <code>render</code> metoda může vypadat třeba takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >return<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Zv</span>íře<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Jm</span>éno<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Typ</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>type<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Předávat můžeme samozřejmě i funkce či objekty. Všechno je jen a pouze čistý JavaScript. Props fungují pouze jednosměrně směrem zhora dolů.</strong> Zvíře tudíž nemá způsob, jak změnit props komponenty Zvířata. Může nicméně dostat od rodičovské komponenty skrz props callback a ten zavolat. Tento jednosměrný postup velmi redukuje komplexnost aplikací.</p>\\n<p>Už víte, že <code>render()</code> se volá při změně props a state. <strong>S jeho voláním se ale navíc přerendruje i celý podstrom potomků.</strong> Pokud by někdo změnil state/props v komponentě Zvířata, tak se zavolají <code>render</code> metody i u komponenty Zvíře.</p>\\n<h2>Zadání úlohy<a id=\\\"zad-n-lohy\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Dnešním cílem bude vytvoření jednoduché databáze aut</strong>. Každé auto bude mít 3 údaje - značku, model a rok výroby. Tyto údaje budou seskupené do karty, která bude umožňovat (roz)skrýt model a rok. Jednotlivá auta budeme moct přidávat a mazat.</p>\\n<h2>Návrh komponent<a id=\\\"n-vrh-komponent\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Při navrhování React aplikací začínáme tím, že si musíme aplikaci rozkouskovat do jednotlivých komponent</strong>. Při rozdělování do komponent se lze přidržet i vizuální podoby. Logickým kandidátem na samostatnou komponentu je karta auta. Další částí rozhraní je formulář pro přidání auta, šup s ním do druhé komponenty. Nakonec potřebujeme ještě někde formulář a auta vypsat a máme tak komponentu třetí - hlavní.</p>\\n<h2>Kam se stavem<a id=\\\"kam-se-stavem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Jaké stavy v aplikaci vlastně budeme mít? Jde především o detaily aut</strong>. Vhodným kandidátem pro uložení je pole objektů, kde každý objekt bude reprezentovat jedno auto. Ale kam s ním? V naší jednoduché aplikaci moc na výběr nemáme. Pole aut musí být v hlavní komponentě, která jednotlivá auta bude vykreslovat.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dalším stavem pak bude to, zda je karta auta rozbalená či zabalená.</strong> Asi vás ihned napadne, že tento stav patří do komponenty auta. Také ho ale můžeme umístit jako další vlasnost objektu auto. Oba přístupy jsou v pohodě.</p>\\n<p>Nicméně, obecným <strong>trendem v React aplikacích je zahnat veškeré stavy někam &quot;do rohu&quot; na jedno místo</strong>. Proč nechceme mít stavy roztroušené po aplikaci? Tak například si představte, že bychom chtěli přidat tlačítko &quot;Rozbal všechna auta&quot;. Podobnou funkcionalitu bychom přirozeně umístili do hlavní komponenty, ale jak pak aktualizovat tento stav v jednotlivých komponentách aut? Není způsob jak komponenty aut proiterovat a zavolat <code>auto.rozbalit()</code>, protože to by byl imperativní přístup, který v Reactu (naštěstí) nefunguje.</p>\\n<p><strong>Komponentu s vnitřním stavem nemůžeme 100% ovládat z vnějšího prostředí</strong>. Pokud však stav vystrčíme někam ven a komponeta bude používat pro své vykreslování pouze zděděné props, dostaneme nad ní plnou kontrolu.</p>\\n<p><strong>Lokální stav je tedy přijatelný pouze, pokud ho nikdy nebudeme potřebovat upravovat či číst vně komponenty</strong>. Nicméně i takovýto superlokální stav můžeme snadno &quot;globalizovat&quot; a mít tak všechny React komponenty &quot;čisté&quot; a plně kontrolovatelné. To si však ukážeme až později s Flux architekturou. A nebojte, je globální stav a globální stav.</p>\\n<h2>Komponenta Auto<a id=\\\"komponenta-auto\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Nejlepším postupem je budovat aplikaci od spoda</strong>, jelikož pak můžete rychle vše testovat, což je vždy lepší než půl hodiny psát kód naslepo. Napíšeme si tedy nejdříve komponentu auto. Představíme si, jak asi bude vypadat objekt auta, který dostaneme skrz props:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\"

metodě <code>render()</code> není mnoho zajímavého. Za zmínku stojí, že <strong>občas jsou některé atributy v JSX přejmenované</strong>. Například <code>for</code> na <code>htmlFor</code>, či <code>class</code> na <code>className</code>. To proto, aby nedocházelo ke kolizím s klíčovými slovy JS. Pokud byste na to však zapomněli, tak vám React poradí v konzoli. React je velmi výřečný co se warningů a errorů týče, což je dobře.</p>\\n<p>Formulář má na sobě pověšený listener <code>onSubmit</code>, který po odeslání zavolá příslušnou metodu. <strong>V ní musíme ihned zavolat <code>e.preventDefault()</code></strong>, jinak by došlo k redirectu aneb standardní chování prohlížeče.</p>\\n<p><strong>Důležitým atributem je <code>ref</code></strong>. Ten se hodí, pokud si chceme &quot;šáhnout&quot; na skutečný DOM element. V JSX si ho pomocí tohoto atributu označkujeme a pak se k němu díky <code>React.findDOMNode(this.refs.foo)</code> můžeme dostat. Vidíte, že k hodnotám formuláře přistupujeme velmi nízkoúrovňově, nepotřebujeme žádnou komplikovanou a zbytečnou abstrakci.</p>\\n<p><strong>V našem příkladě používáme &quot;nekontrolované&quot; vstupní elementy</strong>. Toto je totiž jediná výjimka, kdy React na chvílí přihmouří oči a nechá vás měnit hodnoty v DOMu (value v inputech), aniž by do toho jakkoliv zasahoval. <strong>Existuje však druhý &quot;kontrolovaný&quot; přístup</strong>. Ten je lepší z více důvodů (není potřeba &quot;šahat&quot; na DOM elementy, snadná validace, persistence rozepsaného formuláře atp.), ale o tom bude ještě samostatný článek. V dnešním nám stačí tento první přímočařejší přístup.</p>\\n<p>Formulář si i decentně ostylujeme. Tentokrát pomocí LESSu:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>addCar <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  label <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    width<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> 65px<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n    display<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> inline<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>block<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>Nyní si hotovou komponentu zas vyzkoušíme:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span> from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'react'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Add</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Car</span> from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'./addCar'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >default</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >class</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >Cars</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >extends</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>Component</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Add</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Car</span> add<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>addCar<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >addCar<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>car<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    console<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >log<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>`add $<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>car<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>`<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>A výsledek:</p>\\n<p>$$$cars3$$$</p>\\n<h2>Hlavní komponenta Auta<a id=\\\"hlavn-komponenta-auta\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Teď už nám zbývá to dát vše dohromady</strong> v hlavní komponentě a implementovat metody <code>addCar</code>, <code>toggleCar</code> a <code>removeCar</code>.

Není to úplně hezké řešení, ale nám to pro tuto chvíli stačí. Lepší by bylo nemít auta v poli, ale v objektu (mapě) a přistupovat k nim přímo pomocí <code>id</code>.

Přibyl atribut <code>key={car.id}</code>. Ten slouží čistě potřebám Reactu, aby měl přehled o tom, které elementy v budoucím rendrování zmizí či se jen přemístí. Může pak lépe optimalizovat. Pokud byste <code>key</code> neuvedli, tak vám v konzoli React vynadá, ale kód bude stále funkční.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dílo je u konce.

Navíc si představte, pokud byste měli v sobě zanořených třeba 5 komponent a museli byste si pořád vše předávat skrz props. <strong>Chybí nám tu ono M a C, chybí nám tu zatím Flux</strong>. Dalším nedostatkem je nepoužívání immutable kolekcí, které přinášejí optimalizaci velkou jako Brno. A samozřejmě <strong>formulář by také zasloužil více lásky</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Závěrem<a id=\\\"z-v-rem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Dnes jsme si naprogramovali složitější aplikaci a názorně si demonstrovali základní práci s Reactem.</strong> Páteří každé React aplikace jsou props a předávání dat skrz ně. Při vytváření nových stavů je potřeba velká obezřetnost, protože nám mohou značně zkomplikovat celou aplikaci. Je dobré stavy &quot;vyhnat&quot; na jedno místo, ideálně do root komponenty. <strong>Příště se mrkneme do hloubky na JSX a ukážeme si, že lze používat React i bez něj.</strong></p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ },\n/* 130 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"<h1>React - Úvod<a id=\\\"react-vod\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p><strong>React je JavaScriptová knihovna pro vytváření webových komponent.</strong> V pomyslném MVC představuje &quot;V&quot; neboli view vrstvu a dal by se tak přirovnat například Latte v Nette. React je však daleko více. Přináší totiž zásadní změnu paradigmatu. S Reactem už nepíšeme kód, který něco mění, ale kód, který popisuje, jak má vypadat výsledek, což je řádově snažší úloha. Dvojnásob to pak platí, pokud tím výsledkem je &quot;těžká váha&quot; v podobě DOMu.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width:300px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + __webpack_require__(120) + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"JS knihoven není nikdy dost\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<h2>Trocha historie<a id=\\\"trocha-historie\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>React spatřil světlo světa v květnu 2013</strong>. Opensourcoval ho Facebook, který ho už několik let před tím sám interně používal a vylepšoval. Prvotní vydání se však dočkalo velkého výsměchu. Odezva byla dokonce tak špatná, že Facebook chvíli uvažoval i o jeho stáhnutí. Terčem kritiky se stalo především míchání &quot;HTML a programování&quot;. Podobné obavy nedávno vyjádřili i někteří <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/geekovo/status/604710448131391490\\\">prominentní čeští webaři</a>. Postupně se však ukázalo, že došlo k pouze nepochopení základního konceptu a nejen FE vývojáři si začli rychle osvojovat a užívat nové fundamenty, které React přinesl.</p>\\n<p><strong>K dnešnímu dni</strong> (červenec 2015) <strong>má 4800 commitů, 25 000 stargazerů a 444 contributorů a je tak jedním z nejoblíbenějších a nejaktivnějších repozitářů na GitHubu</strong>. Facebook během této doby uvolnil i další JS projekty jako <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\\\">React Native</a> (React pro iOS a blíží se i vydání Android verze), <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/\\\">Immutable.js</a> (immutable kolekce) či <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a> (M a C doplňující React v pomyslném MVC).</p>\\n<p>Horkou novinkou je pak <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/graphql/\\\">GraphQL</a>, což je dotazovací jazyk, kterým v komponentách popíšete, jaká data ze serveru potřebují. V srpnu 2015 pak vyjde <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/02/20/introducing-relay-and-graphql.html\\\">Relay</a>, který GraphQL bude umět na straně webu zpracovat a rýsuje se nám tak zajímavé řešení pro datovou komunikaci server-client, která dnes představuje nejtěžší část webové aplikace.</p>\\n<h2>Pořád jen Facebook<a id=\\\"po-d-jen-facebook\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Všechny výše uvedené projekty jsou široce používané a je kolem nich mohutná komunita. Nevezou se však na popularitě Reactu, protože s ním nejsou nijak spojené. Jsou prostě tak dobré. <strong>Facebook v posledních letech jednoznačně udává trendy v tvorbě webových aplikací</strong>. Nevytváří velké ucelené frameworky, ale pouze malé pragmatické knihovny s minimalistickým API, což má v JS ekosystému úspěch. Přístup Facebooku k opensource by měl být vzorem i pro další firmy.</p>\\n<p><strong>Druhým webovým hegemonem je Google</strong>, který ale v poslední době působí trochu schizofrenicky. Jakoby si každý jeho tým budoval vlastní framework/knihovnu a tak tu máme vedle sebe <a href=\\\"https://angularjs.org/\\\">Angular</a>, <a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/closure/\\\">Closure Tools</a> a <a href=\\\"https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/\\\">Polymer</a>. Alespoň už zařízl Dart a třeba tak více konsoliduje své síly, co se JS knihoven týče.</p>\\n<h2>Server vs prohlížeč<a id=\\\"server-vs-prohl-e-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Klasické server-side webovky jsou vcelku jednoduché. <strong>Server totiž nemusí udržovat žádný stav</strong>. Přijde mu požadavek od uživatele, poslepuje dohromady nějaké řetězce (část z nich načte třeba z databáze) a celé to pak pošle uživateli do prohlížeče, který to rozparsuje a sestaví DOM (Document Object Model - stromová reprezetace toho co vidíte v prohlížeči jako HTML stránku + metody, kterými se dá upravovat či procházet).</p>\\n<p><strong>Interaktivní JS webovky, které běží v prohlížeči, jsou podstatně složitější</strong>. Chceme totiž po nich daleko více než od server-side aplikací. Chceme nabídnout daleko vyšší uživatelský zážitek. Je trochu zbytečné s každou akcí překreslovat celou stránku, když můžeme změny bleskově provádět pomocí funkcí DOMu a uživateli tak dopřát pohodlí, které zná z desktopových aplikací.</p>\\n<h2>Zlý DOM<a id=\\\"zl-dom\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>DOM a JavaScript jsou dvě úplně rozdílné věci</strong>. Teoreticky by mohl být DOM upravován i jiným jazykem, ale v praxi prohlížeče nabízejí pouze JavaScript. DOM je obrovský moloch, práce s ním je pomalá a prohlížeče nejsou vždy jednotné v jeho implementaci. <strong>JavaScript pak často neprávem sklízí nenávistné komentáře, které by ale měly směřovat právě na DOM</strong>. Dnešní JavaScript je naopak velmi rychlý a vcelku lišácky navržený, což ostatně potvrzuje i to, že se rozšiřuje i do oblastí, kde má narozdíl od prohlížečů silnou konkurenci (node.js).</p>\\n<p>DOM navíc představuje jednu velkou globální proměnnou, což přímo svádí k tomu, abychom ho používali jako místo pro ukládání stavu naší aplikace. Asi nemusím popisovat proč jsou globální proměnné zlo. U DOMu to pak ještě zhoršuje jeho pomalost. <strong>Stav aplikace bychom tedy měli udržovat jinde - v našem JavaScriptu</strong> a do DOMu šahat, jenom když je to skutečně potřeba. Pouze do něj zrcadlit změny z našeho JS kódu. Jenže jak to jednoduše udělat?</p>\\n<h2>Přínos Reactu<a id=\\\"p-nos-reactu\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Nejzřejmější výhoda pro začátečníka je ta, že React nás prakticky úplně odstíní od DOMu</strong>. V React komponentách pouze deklarativně zadefinujeme strukturu (HTML) skládáním JS funkcí. Jinými slovy, popíšeme, jak má vypadat výsledná stránka na základě příchozích dat. React si z toho poskládá svůj vlastní virtuální DOM, který pak pomocí chytrých algoritmů porovnává s tím skutečným DOMem a když najde rozdíly, tak ho nejefektivnějším možným způsobem aktualizuje. <strong>My už pak jenom dodáváme nová data do jednotlivých komponent a tím pro nás veškerá práce končí</strong>. V prohlížeči vždy uvidíte aktuální pohled vzhledem k dodaným datům. Tohle je &quot;deal breaker&quot;, který vám pravděpodobně není úplně zřejmý, pokud už nemáte předešlou trpkou zkušenost s imperativním přístupem u větší aplikace, což je typicky jQuery a fidlování s jednotlivými DOM elementy.</p>\\n<h2>Začínáme<a id=\\\"za-n-me\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Je načase si ukázat první příklad. Komponenty si budete moc vyzkoušet přímo v rámci této stránky nebo zkopírováním do svého <a href=\\\"prvni-dev-stack.html\\\">vymazleného stacku</a>. Najdete je samozřejmě také v <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tajo/javascript/tree/master/examples/react\\\">repozitáři</a>. Budu téměř výhradně používat novou čerstvě vydanou ES6 syntax.</p>\\n<p>Naše první komponenta se bude jmenovat <code>Counter</code> a <strong>bude udržovat a zobrazovat počet našich kliknutí</strong>. Hned se podívejte na výsledek:</p>\\n<p>$$$counter$$$</p>\\n<p>A teď si to pojďme rozebrat a naprogramovat. Jak už to bývá, ani u Reactu se neobejdme bez minimálního boilerplate kódu:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span> from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'react'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >default</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >class</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >Counter</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >extends</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>Component</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span></code><p><strong>Nikdy nesmíme zapomenout na importování Reactu</strong>. I když to není na první pohled zřejmé, tak ony HTML tagy (JSX) jsou ve skutečnosti převlečené funkce Reactu, ale to bychom teď předbíhali. Novou komponentu jednoduše oddědíme od <code>React.Component</code> a <code>export default class Counter</code> nám komponentu zpřístupní napříč celou aplikací.</p>\\n<p><strong>React komponenty mají pouze jednu povinnou metodu a to <code>render()</code></strong>. V ní se očekává, že popíšete strukturu komponenty včetně jejích závislostí na data. Metoda musí pak vrátit 1 root element (například <code>&lt;div/&gt;</code>), který už může mít libovolný počet potomků včetně dalších React komponent. Takhle vypadá ta naše:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Kliknul</span> jsi <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>state<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>counter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>br<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>button onClick<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>e<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span> <span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >handleClick<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>e<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Klikni</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >!</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>button<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Povšimněte si, že &quot;uprostřed&quot; JSX zápisu můžete opět vkládat JS výrazy</strong>, pokud je obalíte do <code>{}</code> a takhle to můžete prokladát do několika úrovní, pokud máte rádi nepřehledný kód. JSX velmi připomíná klasické HTML a rozdílů byste našli jen několik. Což je vcelku zajímavé, protože pod pokličkou jde o principálně zcela jinou věc.</p>\\n<p><code>this.state</code> je jeden ze dvou hlavních objektů, který &quot;krmí&quot; React komponenty daty. O tom druhém <code>this.props</code> a rozdílech si povíme až příště. <strong><code>this.state</code> je lokální stav komponenty, do kterého si můžeme ukládat libovolná data</strong>. Nám se hodí pro uložení počtu kliknutí. Pomocí <code>{this.state.counter}</code> si tento počet pak jednoduše vypíšeme.</p>\\n<p>Klikací tlačítko má atribut <code>onClick</code>. <strong>Vzpomínáte na poučku, že se nemají používat tyto inline atributy pro volání JS? Tak ta stále platí.</strong> Nicméně protože <code>&lt;button/&gt;</code> je ve skutečnosti JS funkce a ne HTML element, tak i <code>onClick</code> nemá s tím klasickým moc společného.</p>\\n<p>React má totiž propracované delegování eventů a tak i když budete mít v aplikaci tisíc onClicků, tak z nich React udělá jenom jeden, který pověsí na root element a příchozí eventy nechá probublat k patřičným odběratelům. To velmi šetří výkon a vám nervy, pokud byste podobnou (a nutnou) optimalizaci museli sami implementovat. V Reactu tak můžete libovolně &quot;plýtvat&quot; s listenery jako <code>onKeyDown</code>, <code>onCopy</code>, <code>onFocus</code>, <code>onScroll</code> ...

Pokud jste zmatení z pojmů jako closure, scope nebo context, tak si <a href=\\\"http://ryanmorr.com/understanding-scope-and-context-in-javascript/\\\">přečtěte tento článek</a>. Jde o fundamenty, které dělají JS tím čím je.</p>\\n<p>Kde se vlastně bere state neboli stav komponenty? Musíme ho nejprve inicializovat a to se nemůže dít nikde jinde než v konstruktoru:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >constructor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >super<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>state <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>counter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\" >0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>Zbývá si už jen napsat funkci, která se zavolá kliknutím na naše tlačítko:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >handleClick<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>e<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >setState<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>previousState <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>counter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> previousState<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>counter <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >+</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\" >1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Stav komponenty se vždy a pouze mění pomocí metody <code>this.setState()</code></strong>. Vyvarujte se pokušení napsat <code>this.state =</code>, protože by se vám pak nezavolal <code>render()</code>. Do <code>setState</code> můžeme jako první argument předat přímo novou hodnotu stavu nebo funkci, do které dostaneme předchozí stav (a props), což se právě hodí pro inkrementování. Náš případ by šel zapsat i jako:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >handleClick<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>e<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >setState<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>counter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>state<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>counter <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >+</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\" >1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Kdy a jak probíhá překreslení?</strong> To už má plně v režii React. K zavolání metody <code>render()</code> dochází, pokud se změní <code>this.state</code> nebo <code>this.props</code>, případně, pokud zavoláme <code>forceUpdate()</code>. <strong>Metoda render vygeneruje nový virtuální DOM a porovná ho s tím skutečným v prohlížeči</strong>. Pokud najde nějaké změny, tak je nejefektivnějším způsobem aplikuje. Svižné a elegantní. Nikde jsme nemuseli definovat, jak, kdy a které DOM elementy je potřeba aktualizovat. <strong>Pouze jsme popsali strukturu a její vztah k datům.</strong></p>\\n<p>Výsledný kód:</p>\\n<code

Jedním ze strašáků &quot;programování v prohlížeči&quot; je DOM, často chybně a neférově zaměňován s JavaScriptem. React nám mj. umožňuje téměř kompletní abstrakci od DOMu. Strukturu jednotlivých komponent zapisujeme (deklarujeme) skládáním React funkcí, kterým následně dodáváme data a tím pro nás práce končí. React toho nabízí samozřejmě daleko více. Nakousli jsme třeba i systém eventů. <strong>S Reactem je to tak trochu jako dobrým čajem nebo kafem</strong>. Zpočátku vám bude připadat divný a musíte se k němu postupně &quot;propít&quot;.

Naše aplikace (zdrojové kódy) jsou distribuovány pomocí pomalého a nespolehlivého protokolu HTTP do vzdáleného prohlížeče. Tam se musí ihned zparsovat, spustit a něco provést.

Každá část (stránka) naší aplikace potřebuje pravděpodobně různé skripty a tak můžeme dle URL adresy posílat speciální menší bundly, kde bude jen to, co daná stránka skutečně potřebuje. Kód, který používají všechny stránky (typicky knihovna jako jQuery či React), pak dáme do  <code>&lt;script src=&quot;common.js&quot;&gt;</code>, který bude všude - využijeme tak cache prohlížeče. <strong>To samé můžeme udělat s CSS</strong>. Obrázky pak můžeme vhodně cacheovat (verzovat) a ty, které mají jen pár kB, rovnou vložit zakódované do HTML jako base64 - ušetříme tak další drahocenné requesty. <strong>To zní jako hodně otravné práce, že?</strong></p>\\n<p>Ano, to je hodně práce! Naštěstí existuje geniální webpack, který tohle vše dokáže vyřešit za nás. Jediné co musíme udělat my je <strong>explicitní uvádění závislostí</strong>. V hantýrce ES6 jde o <code>import</code>, v ES5 pak o <code>require</code>. U našich JS modulů to dělat musíme tak jako tak, ale ta převratná myšlenka webpacku spočívá v tom, že úplně stejným způsobem <strong>budeme uvádět (importovat) i CSS, obrázky, fonty</strong> a vlastně úplně cokoliv co daná stránka / komponenta / balíček potřebuje ke svému životu.</p>\\n<p>Webpack pak projde všechny soubory (importy) a sestaví komplexní graf závislostí. Ještě mu musíme ukázat, kde začít, co ignorovat, čím jednotlivé formáty zpracovat (loadery) a jaký od něho očekáváme výstup (jeden velký bundle, více menších bundlů ...). <strong>Výstup pak bude 100% optimální</strong>. Každá část aplikace dostane &quot;na cestu&quot; jen to co skutečně potřebuje a nic zbytečně navíc. Hurá!</p>\\n<p><strong>Webpack má obsáhlou <a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/docs/\\\">dokumentaci</a></strong>, která je ale trochu nepřehledná. Můžete také nahlédnout do <a href=\\\"https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto\\\">hezkého shrnutí</a> od Pete Hunta. Nejlepší ale je použít již nějaký hotový boilerplate a na něm experimentovat. Webpack je velký a mocný nástroj, který je zároveň i extrémně modulární díky loaderům a pluginům. <strong>Není však úplně snadné ho nastavit</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Hot module replacement<a id=\\\"hot-module-replacement\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Ještě si dovolím jednu malou kecací odbočku, protože pěvně věřím, že v blízké budoucnosti to bude velká věc! Jde o další skvělou funkci webpacku. Slouží čistě vývojářům během vývoje aplikace. Jde o hot module replacement. <strong>Je to cesta, kterou je možné vyměňovat, přidávat a mazat moduly již v běžící aplikaci. Změny se pak na stránce projeví okamžitě bez reloadu.</strong></p>\\n<p>Proč je to tak převratné? <strong>Ohromně to zrychluje a zpříjemňuje vývoj</strong>. Refresh je nejen pomalý ale hlavně se při něm ztrácí stav aplikace. Například rozepsaný formulář nebo posloupnost kroků, kterou jste se dostali do nějaké skryté části aplikace (nedostupné přes URL).</p>\\n<p>Jak tahle magie funguje? Webpack-dev-server si pomocí socketů povídá s webpack runtime (přiložený bundle k hlavnímu skriptu stránky) a oznámí mu, když uložíte (aktualizujete) nějaký soubor. <strong>Webpack runtime se pak zeptá původního starého modulu, jestli umí zpracovat aktualizaci</strong>, pokud ne, tak jde tato výzva stromem závislostí výše. Pokud se nenajde nikdo, kdo by aktualizaci dokázal provést, tak se udělá klasický refresh. Musíme psát ke každému modulu potenciálně velmi komplikovanou accept metodu?</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width:334px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + __webpack_require__(121) + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Hot reload pro React\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>To by nikdo nedělal. <strong>Naštěstí pro React komponenty je to možné vcelku snadno generalizovat</strong>. Mají totiž jasně daný life-cycle a rerendrování části DOMu bez ztráty state je jejich základní vlastností. A tak vzniknul <a href=\\\"http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/\\\">react-hot-loader</a>. Pro UI část je hot reload nejvíce užitečný, jelikož právě ji nejčastěji testujeme a právě ona obsahuje stav. Nicméně při jistých konvencích se dá celý flux reimplementovat tak, aby bylo možné hot reload použít pro celou aplikaci, jak ukazuje <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gaearon/redux\\\">redux</a>. Taková aplikace je pak shodou okolností i velmi dobře testovatelná.</p>\\n<p>Dnes představuje hot reload černou magii, která funguje, ale jde z ní respekt. Dovedu si však představit, že <strong>příští rok, už budeme knihovny dělit na ty, které hot reload podporují a ty které nikoliv</strong>. Hackování v JS bude ještě víc zábavné než dnes!</p>\\n<h2>Struktura aplikace<a id=\\\"struktura-aplikace\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">dev<span class=\\\"token operator\\\"

kompletně běžet pouze v prohlížeči, pořád nám jí někdo musí do toho prohlížeče naservírovat</strong>. Potřebujeme server. Pro to úplně nejjednodušší použití potřebujeme od serveru to, aby nám vrátil základní HTML strukturu s prázdným <code>&lt;body /&gt;</code> a naší JS aplikací <code>&lt;script src=&quot;build/bundle.js&quot;&gt;</code>. Dále ještě potřebujeme, aby se ve vývojovém módu nahradil hotový <code>build/bundle.js</code> za webpack-dev-server <code>&lt;script src=&quot;//localhost:8888/build/app.js&quot;&gt;</code>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Takový server může být v PHP, Pythonu, Javě či vašem oblíbeném jazyce XXX</strong>. Asi vás úplně nepřekvapí, že my šáhneme opět po JavaScriptu a to <strong>node.js</strong>. Mít prohlížečovou část, serverovou část a nástroje včetně jejich nastavení v jednom jazyce nabízí řadu výhod. Je snadné sdílet stejný kód (router, validace). Lze jednoduše přepínat mezi produkčním a vývojovým režimem. To jsou takové příjemné bonusy. <strong>Pak se nabízí ale i možnost server-side renderování Reactu, kterou už bez node.js nemáte</strong>. Tu však zatím rozebírat nebudeme.</p>\\n<p>Jelikož se tato série soustředí především na tu prohlížečovou část, tak se samotným nodem moc zabývat prozatím nebudeme. Ostatně existuje už i <a href=\\\"http://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/javascript-na-serveru-zaciname-s-node-js/\\\">český node.js seriál</a>, i když už trochu zastaralý.</p>\\n<p>Hlavní soubor <code>index.js</code> vypadá takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >require<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'babel/register'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token function\\\" >require<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'./main'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p>Pokud chceme používat Babel v prohlížeči, musíme nejdříve náš kód prohnat Babel kompilátorem a prohlížeči poslat až výsledný JavaScript. V prostředí node.js můžeme udělat to samé. Nicméně díky tomu, že nemusíme řešit spojování modulů, minimalizaci a prohlížeče, tak existují i další možnosti. Například <strong>lze místo node používat <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/#babel-node\\\">babel-node</a></strong>. Pro spuštění serveru pak použijete příkaz <code>babel-node index</code> místo <code>node index</code>. Další a <strong>elegantní možností je výše použitý <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/require/\\\">require hook</a> <code>require(&#39;babel/register&#39;)</code></strong>. Babel se nabinduje na nodí require a bude kompilovat soubory za běhu (počínaje <code>./main.js</code>).</p>\\n<p>Soubor <code>main.js</code> je už zajímavější:</p>\\n<code

Nepotřebujeme už Apache či Nginx, protože node umí obstarat HTTP komunikaci sám. Express je nejpoužívanější node framework, se kterým je hračka napsat například jakékoliv API.</p>\\n<p><strong>Nám stačí pouze jedno pravidlo</strong>. V metodě <code>app.get</code> říkáme, že na jakoukoliv adresu nám má server poslat daný řetězec, který reprezentuje naší prázdnou HTML stránku. Tedy krom adresáře <code>/build</code>, ve kterém budeme mít naše bundly či obrázky.</p>\\n<p>Trošku jsem v úvodu lhal o té jediné React komponentě. Tady je totiž druhá s názvem <code>Html</code>. <strong><code>React.renderToStaticMarkup</code> vrátí DOM v podobě prostého řetězce</strong>. Existuje ještě metoda <code>React.renderToString</code>, která vrací to samé, avšak každý element dostane ještě speciální atribut <code>data-reactid</code>. <strong>To se hodí pro server-side rendering</strong>. Po té co se takováto komponenta vykreslí v prohlížeči, React už bude mít díky idčkům kompletní přehled o struktuře DOMu a může se na ní ihned napojit. To však pro elementy jako <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> či <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> nepotřebujeme, jelikož na ty React už nikdy šahat nebude.</p>\\n<p>Než přejdeme na rozbor naší první reactí komponenty, mrkněme na <code>config.js</code>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >default</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  isProduction<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> process<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>env<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>NODE_ENV <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >===</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'production'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  port<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> process<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>env<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>PORT <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >||</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\" >8000</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  version<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >require<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'../../package'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>version\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p><strong>Režim vyčteme z globální proměnné process.env.NODE_ENV</strong>, jak už je u nodu zvykem. Obdobně můžeme v prostředí nastavit i PORT, jinak se použije <code>8000</code>. Také se nám hodí <code>version</code>, který si můžeme vyzobnout z našeho vlastního <code>package.json</code>. Následně ho totiž přilepíme k <code>build/bundle.js?v=version</code>, abychom si s každou novou verzí vynutili invalidování prohlížečové cache.

popíšeme až v dalším článku</strong>. Zde jen uvedu, že ve vývojovém režimu nevkládáme CSS soubor pomocí <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, ale děje se tak javascriptovou cestou, aby nám mj. fungoval hot reload. Zbytek je ona prázdná HTML struktura, vložení naší budoucí JS aplikace a také prázdný <code>div</code> s <code>id=&quot;app-root&quot;</code>, do kterého v prohlížeči vyrendrujeme naši Reactí aplikaci. <strong>Nikdy jí nerendrujte přímo do <code>body</code> elementu, jelikož do něj rádi svévolně šahají i různé další knihovny, což pak způsobuje Reactu značný bolehlav</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Server si nyní můžete pustit příkazem:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">node index</code><p>V produkčním režimu pak jako:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">NODE_ENV<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span>production node index</code><p>Nyní si otevřte Chrome a mrkněte na <code>http://localhost:8000</code>. Měli byste tam nalézt velké bíle nic - právě to jsme si totiž zatím vytvořili. Zda jde o dobré nic, zkontrolujte nahlédnutím do zdrojového kódu stránky.</p>\\n<h2>Front-end<a id=\\\"front-end\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Naše dnešní aplikace bude triviální. Vytvoříme si jedinou React komponentu, která nám vypíše &quot;Hello world!&quot;. Také do ní přidáme pár obrázků a styly, abychom si ukázali, jak funguje Webpack. Vstupní bod aplikace index.js vypadá takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span> from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'react'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Main</span> from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'./main'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >const</span> app <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> document<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >getElementById<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'app-root'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Main</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> app<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p>V DOMu si vylovíme div, do kterého pak vyrendrujeme naši jedinou hlavní komponentu <code>Main</code>. Děsí vás ty špičaté závorky? Říkáte si, že to není validní JS syntax? Ano, není. <strong>Nicméně Babel dané syntaxi rozumí (JSX) a překládá jí do normálních JS funkcí</strong>.

Potřeba minimalizace a mazání nepoužívaných CSS je asi všem jasná. <strong>Proč se ale zaobírat obrázky, když ty se nahrávají asynchronně a jen když jsou potřeba i bez nějakého webpacku?</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Obrázky menší než např. 8kB můžeme automaticky <strong>enkódovat do base64</strong> a vložit přímo do HTML. Tím ušetříme zbytečný HTTP request.</li>\\n<li><strong>Pojmenování</strong>. Webpack obrázky přejmenuje na jejich hash a přesune do společného <code>/build</code> adresáře. Prohlížeč je tak může cacheovat &quot;navždy&quot;, pokud se změní, tak se změní i jejich název.</li>\\n<li><strong>Lepší struktura a opravdová modularita</strong>. Obrázky totiž můžeme mít přímo u jednotlivých komponent, aniž bychom veřejně odhalovali strukturu naší aplikace. Stejně jako styly a vše ostatní.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Pokud se vám nelíbí představa, že byste museli všechny obrázky uvádět přes import, nezoufejte. Webpack umí poznat a vytáhnout název importu i přímo ze <code>src=&quot;&quot;</code>, když si to nastavíte pomocí <a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html#query\\\">loader query</a>.</p>\\n<p>Pro úplnou přehlednost ještě uvedu obsah souboru <code>main.less</code>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>hello <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  color<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> #ff0000<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  font<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>size<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> 3em<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n  img <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    display<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> block<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><h2>Nastavení Gulpu<a id=\\\"nastaven-gulpu\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Už jsme hotoví s dnešní aplikací (serverem i front-endem)</strong>. Zbývá však ještě konfigurace a uvedení k životu. Proč máme v projektu Gulp i Webpack zároveň? Je pravda, že Webpack do velké míry dokáže spousty činností Gulpu nahradit a s trochou skriptování v <code>package.json</code> bychom se Gulpu dokázali zbavit úplně. Nicméně bude se nám hodit pro samotné spouštění Webpacku a také ESLintu. ESLint má sice také vlastní loader pro webpack, ale v našem nastavení webpacku budeme potlačovat většinu (výstupů) errorů, aby se nám nerozbíjel (nepřerušoval) hot reloading. Bohužel s tím bychom přišli i o výstup ESLintu.</p>\\n<p>Základem konfigurace Gulpu je <code>gulpfile.js</code>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token comment\\\"

Webpack očekává, že mu prvním parametrem předáme konfiguraci. Tu naši si sestavíme v souboru <code>makeconfig.js</code>. Asi jste všimli, že tu dnes trochu míchám ES5 a ES6 (Babel). Pro konfiguraci samotných build nástrojů je jednodušší použít čistý (starý) JS. Navíc ES5 je subset ES6 (Babelu), takže si stejně musíte zvyknout na obě syntaxe. Samotné zdrojové kódy budou téměř vždy jen v Babelu, občas uvedu (formou záložky) i starší zápis.</p>\\n<p>Konfiguraci si obalíme do funkce, které předáme to, zda chceme verzi pro produkci či vývoj:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">module<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>isDevelopment<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">// ...\\n</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>Konfigurace je jeden velký objekt:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> config <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  cache<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> isDevelopment<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  debug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> isDevelopment<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  devtool<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> isDevelopment <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >?</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'eval-source-map'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >''</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">// ...\\n</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>Webpack agresivně <a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#cache\\\">cacheuje</a> jednotlivé moduly a chunky, což výrazně zlepšuje rychlost inkrementálních buildů. To se nám samozřejmě velmi hodi pro vývoj. <a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#debug\\\">Debug</a> nám nastaví loadery do debug režimu. <a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#devtool\\\">Devtool</a> nám nabízí různé možnosti pro nastavení source-map.</p>\\n<p>Dále musíme uvést vstupní bod naší aplikace:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> config <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">// ...\\n</span>  entry<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> isDevelopment <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >?</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >[</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'webpack-dev-server/client?http://localhost:8888'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'webpack/hot/only-dev-server'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'./src/client/index.js'</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >]</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >[</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'./src/client/index.js'</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">// ...\\n</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>V případě vývojového režimu musíme krom <code>src/client/index.js</code> uvést i webpack-dev-server, tak aby nám fungoval hot-reload.</p>\\n<p>Následně musíme specifikovat loadery pro jednotlivé typy importovaných souborů.

Pomocí <code>exclude</code> je pak možné vyloučit některé importy, což se hodí pro <code>/node_modules</code>.</p>\\n<p><strong>První loader nám zpracovává obrázky</strong>. Pokud jsou menší než 8kB, tak je převede do base64. Vrátí pak URL adresu obrázku. <strong>Druhý loader se aplikuje na všechny JavaScriptové soubory</strong>. Prožene je babel transformací. Ve vývojovém režimu navíc ještě react hot loaderem, který nám přidá accept metody k React komponentám.</p>\\n<p><strong>Poslední loader pak zpracovává LESS importy</strong>. <code>lessLoaders</code> je zkratkou pro:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">css<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>loader<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >!</span>autoprefixer<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>loader<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >?</span>browsers<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span>last <span class=\\\"token number\\\" >2</span> version<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >!</span>less<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>loader</code><p>Nejdříve projde LESS import LESS transformací, následně autoprefixer-loaderem, který nám přidá prefixy nutné pro poslední 2 verze prohlížečů. <code>Css-loader</code> pak vyřeší importy <code>url(...)</code>. A nakonec <code>style-loader</code>, který nám styly vloží do DOMu.</p>\\n<p>V produkčním režimu aplikujeme na výsledek ještě <strong><code>ExtractTextPlugin</code>, který nám ze všech jednotlivých stylů vytvoří samostatný CSS soubor</strong>. V opačném případě jsou naše styly přímo inlinovány javascriptem, což může být pomalé a problematické u starších prohlížečů. Ovšem pro vývoj je to naopak fajn, bude nám fungovat hot-reload.</p>\\n<p>Webpack nyní ví co zpracovávat a pomocí jakých loaderů (transformací). <strong>Nyní mu ještě zbývá říct, jak má vypadat výstup</strong>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> config <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">// ...\\n</span>  output<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> isDevelopment <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >?</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >join<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>__dirname<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'/build/'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    filename<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'app.js'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    publicPath<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'http://localhost:8888/build/'</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'build/'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    filename<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'app.js'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    publicPath<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'build/'</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">// ...\\n</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Naše aplikace je jednoduchá a proto nám stačí jeden výstupní společný bundle</strong>. Ten se uloží do adresáře <code>/build</code>. Krom <code>app.js</code> se nám tam pak objeví i obrázky a CSS bundle <code>app.css</code>. Ve vývojovém režimu nám skripty a styly bude servírovat přímo webpack-dev-server, který poběží na <code>http://localhost:8888/</code>.</p>\\n<p>Dále můžeme ještě v konfiguraci specifikovat

<code>webpack.optimize.DedupePlugin</code> zkusí najít stejné či podobné soubory a vyhodit je z výsledného výstupu, tak aby se zmenšila celková velikost bundlu. <code>webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin</code> je další optimalizace, která zmenší výsledný bundle. Nakonec ještě použijeme <code>UglifyJsPlugin</code>. Ten významně minimalizuje JavaScriptový kód a provede další optimalizace (trvá to).</p>\\n<p>Nakonec ještě řekneme webpacku, které defaultní přípony (typy souborů) má umět importovat i bez toho aniž

Avšak tentokrát je obalen webpack-dev-serverem, což je samostatný node.js server, který se postará o aktualizaci změn (assets během vývoje stahujeme z něj). Musíme jen specifikovat na jaké adrese a portu bude běžet a pak také ignorovat výpisy, kterými jinak mohutně spamuje terminál. <code>gutil.PluginError</code> nám pak odchytí chyby během kompilace a vypíše je do terminálu.</p>\\n<h2>Celý dev-stack<a id=\\\"cel-dev-stack\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>A to je vše!</strong> Celý dev stack najdete v <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tajo/javascript\\\">repozitáři této stránky</a> v adresáři <code>/examples</code>. Z terminálu se k funkčnímu stavu můžete dopracovat touto sadou příkazů (předpokládá se, že máte nainstalovaný node a npm):</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">git clone git@github<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>com<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span>tajo<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>javascript<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>git\\ncd javascript<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>examples<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>dev<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>stack\\nnpm install\\nnpm install <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>g gulp\\ngulp</code><p>Po otevření prohlížeče na adrese <code>http://localhost:8000</code> byste měli vidět to co je na úvodním gifu. Taktéž by měl fungovat hot-reload. Otevřte si konzoli. Ne vždy hot-reload funguje (u změn mimo React komponenty). <strong>V konzoli vám pak webpack napíše, že máte provést ruční reload stránky. Proč ho neděláme automaticky? Protože je to otravné.</strong> V praxi se pak stává, že si nechtíc něco uložíte, udělá se refresh a ztratí se vám stav. Prozkoumejte také tab <code>Elements</code> a mrkněte na to, jak vypadá výsledný DOM ve vývojovém a produkčním režimu.</p>\\n<h2>Závěrem<a id=\\\"z-v-rem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Postavili jsme si jednoduchý, ale moderní JS dev-stack</strong>, který splňuje všechna očekávání vytyčená v úvodu. Nabízí nám pohodlný vývojový režim s hot-reloadem a bohatými výpisy (včetně source-map), které nám značně usnadní vývoj. V produkčním režimu nám pak webpack vytvoří maximálně optimalizovaný výstupní bundle s našimi skripty, styly a obrázky. Serverovou část naší aplikace jsme vyřešili v node.js. Základní HTML stránku si lze ale stejně dobře naservírovat i jakoukoliv jinou technologií, třeba Apachem s PHP. <strong>Příště si představíme React a konečně si něco naprogramujeme.</strong></p>\\n\";\n\n/***/ },\n/* 132 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = \"<p><strong>Vítejte!</strong> Zde se budou postupně objevovat články zaměřené na vývoj moderních interaktivních webovek, kde hlavní slovo má <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>React</strong> a <strong>Flux</strong>.

Babel.<a id=\\\"javascript-babel-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p>JavaScript má oproti většině ostatních jazyků jedno specifikum. Je sám o sobě poměrně <strong>nepoužitelný</strong>. Na vině je především způsob, jakým dochází k uvádění jeho nových verzí. Jak si s tím úspěšně a elegantně poradit?</p>\\n<h2>JavaScript vs ECMAScript<a id=\\\"javascript-vs-ecmascript\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>JavaScript je pouze jednou z implementací standardu jménem <strong>ECMAScript</strong>. Díky obrovské popularitě JavaScriptu se ovšem tyto dva termíny často libovolně zaměňují. Existují však ještě další implementace jako JScript či ActionScript.</p>\\n<p>Ecma International od roku 1997 postupně vydává jednotlivé specifikace. Poslední stabilní verze je <strong><a href=\\\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?id=start&amp;cache=cache&amp;media=resources:es5_errata_7-31-10.pdf\\\">5.1 z roku 2011</a></strong>. Letos v létě pak přijde nová edice s pořadovým číslem 6 označovaná také kódem <strong>ES6</strong> či <strong>Harmony</strong>. K dispozici je už <a href=\\\"http://wiki.ecmascript.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?id=harmony%3Aspecification_drafts&amp;cache=cache&amp;media=harmony:ecma-262_6th_edition_final_draft_-04-14-15.pdf\\\">finální draft</a>. Zároveň se nám rodí i verze číslo 7.</p>\\n<h2>Podpora prohlížečů<a id=\\\"podpora-prohl-e-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Asi vás nepřekvapí, že několik let stará specifikace 5.1 je dnes plně podporovaná napříč všemi prohlížeči. Co vás ovšem možná zaskočí je fakt, že výrobci prohlížečů <strong>nečekají s implementací</strong> nových specifikací na stabilní verze a tak už dnes například <strong>Chrome podporuje 45% funkcí Harmony</strong>, Firefox 69%, Internet Explorer 16%, Spartan 73% a Safari 20%. Aby toho nebylo málo, tak se v prohlížečích začínají objevovat i funkce z ECMAScriptu 7 a to navzdory tomu, že jsou teprve ve stádiu raného návrhu. Poměrně <strong>slušná anarchie</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Co s tím?<a id=\\\"co-s-t-m-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>My, tvůrci webových aplikací, musíme zajistit, aby naše stránky správně fungovaly ve všech běžně používaných prohlížečích. Jak si ale poradit s tím, že každý prohlížeč podporuje jiný set standardu Harmony? Nejjednodušším řešením je se zatím 6. verzi zcela vyhnout a <strong>používat pouze funkce z verze 5.1</strong>, která je již plně etablovaná. Nicméně tím se ocitnete v pozici malého dítěte, které v hračkárně toužebně pokukuje po mluvících a chodících robůtcích, zatímco doma si ještě několik let bude muset hrát s klacky a kameny. Předchozí příklad je samozřejmě nadsázka. Tak propastný rozdíl mezi verzemi zase není. Nicméně nebojte, existují lepší řešení.</p>\\n<h2>Shimujeme<a id=\\\"shimujeme\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>ES6 přináší dva typy novinek. Tou první jsou <strong>nové objekty a funkce</strong> na již existujících objektech. K těm si můžeme dopomoci jednoduše tím, že k projektu připojíme kusy kódu nazývané <a href=\\\"https://github.com/es-shims\\\">shimy a polyfilly</a>. Ty pak detekují chybějící či odlišné API jednotlivých prohlížečů a následně je doplní a sjednotí. V budoucnu, až budou prohlížeče daný standard plně podporovat, můžeme tyto knihovny úplně odstranit.</p>\\n<h2>Kompilujeme<a id=\\\"kompilujeme\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Druhou novinkou je nová syntax. V ES6 nám například přibyla nová klíčová slova jako <code>class</code>, <code>extends</code>, <code>let</code> či <code>import</code>. Tady si bohužel pouze s připojenou knihovnou už nevystačíme. Musíme použít <strong>program - kompilátor</strong>, který náš kód přeloží do starší plně podporované verze. V našem případě ES5. Navíc vyřeší i ony nové objekty a funkce z předchozí kapitoly (někdy ale bude i tak potřeba přidat polyfill). I zde platí, že v budoucnu budeme moct kompilátor z procesu úplně vynechat a náš kód bude v prohlížečích fungovat bez dodatečných úprav.</p>\\n<h2>V budoucnu?<a id=\\\"v-budoucnu-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Problém ovšem je, že jakmile budou prohlížeče plně podporovat ES6, tak tu budeme mít finální specifikaci ES7 a mlsně pokukovat po ES8. Prakticky to znamená jediné. <strong>Samotný JavaScript nikdy používat nemůžeme</strong>, pokud nechceme být neustále 4 roky pozadu. Nejlepším řešením je tedy vždy používat jazyk kompilovaný do JavaScriptu.</p>\\n<h2>Kompilátory<a id=\\\"kompil-tory\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Nových jazyků a kompilátorů existuje celá řada. Dají se rozdělit do 2 základních kategorií. Tou první jsou zcela nové jazyky, které mají úplně odlišnou syntax a nemůžeme je tedy použít na vylepšení již hotových projektů. Jde například o populární <a href=\\\"http://coffeescript.org\\\">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href=\\\"http://www.purescript.org\\\">PureScript</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript\\\">ClojureScript</a> či <a href=\\\"https://www.dartlang.org\\\">Dart</a> (ten se snažil dokonce úplně emancipovat od JS ale neúspěšně). Druhou kategorií jsou jazyky, které současný JavaScript pouze rozšiřují a snaží se více či méně zachovat dopřednou kompatibilitu. Jde třeba o <a href=\\\"http://www.typescriptlang.org\\\">TypeScript</a>, <a href=\\\"https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler\\\">Traceur</a> či <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io\\\">Babel</a>. Vzájemným porovnáváním by se dalo popsat několik dalších stránek, proto ho nechávám na každém z vás. Dále se budu věnovat pouze poslednímu jmenovanému.</p>\\n<h2>Babel<a id=\\\"babel\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Babel nedávno vznikl přejmenováním z <strong>6to5</strong>, rychle se dostal na špičku popularity a získává stále větší momentum. <strong>Proč je úspěšný?</strong> Hlavním důvodem je jednoduše <a href=\\\"https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/\\\">nejširší podpora ES6 (77%) i ES7 (61%)</a>. Plně integruje <strong>JSX a React</strong> (taková ta podivnost, kdy píšete HTML tagy přímo do těla JavaScriptových funkcí). Skvěle si rozumí s editory a různými nástroji.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width:250px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/babel.jpg\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Babel - nová generace JavaScriptu\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Používají ho už dnes firmy jako <strong>Facebook, Yahoo, Netflix, Mozilla a Evernote</strong>. Můžete ho nasadit na serverovém prostředí <strong>node.js</strong>. Je to ale stále onen čistý JavaScript, takže s ním můžete bez problémů zkompilovat i svoje stávající projekty a s ES6 začít postupně.</p>\\n<h2>Co tedy ES6 přináší?<a id=\\\"co-tedy-es6-p-in-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Je toho spousta. Zmíním jenom pár těch nejzásadnějších věcí. Bylo by asi zbytečné kompletně překládat <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/\\\">tuto povedenou dokumentaci</a> (ukázky kódu jsou zkopírované z této dokumentace).</p>\\n<h3>Třídy<a id=\\\"t-dy\\\">&nbsp;</a></h3><p>Rozlučte se s <code>prototype</code>.

Pro více detailů navštivte <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6\\\">dokumentaci</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Závěrem<a id=\\\"z-v-rem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>JavaScript už dávno není pouze doplňkovou hračkou v prohlížečích, ale začíná nám ovládat i ostatní platformy. Velké firmy do něj investují nemálo peněz a jeho vývoj tak probíhá překotným tempem. Díky tomu pak vznikají špičkové nástroje jako je Babel. To co na první pohled vypadá jako divoká džungle, tak nakonec příspívá k pružnějšímu vývoji, nutí výrobce prohlížečů rychleji implementovat nové funkce a programátor tím přesto nemusí trpět. Co si tedy z článku odnést? Jednoduché ponaučení! Vždy si přidejte Babel do svého vývojářského procesu a užívejte si budoucnost už dnes. <strong>JavaScript je mrtev, ať žije Babel!</strong></p>\\n\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./content/Babel/index.md\n ** module id = 126\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"<h1>Nástroje<a id=\\\"n-stroje\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p>Tak jako truhlář potřebuje hoblík, pilu nebo nebozez, tak i <strong>vývojář webovek se neobejde bez pořádných nástrojů</strong>. Když si vyberete ty správné a naučíte se s nimi pořádně zacházet, značně usnadní a zrychlí vaši práci. V tomto článku se s nimi v rychlosti seznámíme.</p>\\n<h2>Operační systém<a id=\\\"opera-n-syst-m\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Vezmeme to pěkně od základu a tím je operační systém. Nemá smysl chodit kolem horké kaše. Sami asi tušíte, že tím <strong>slonem v místnosti je Windows</strong>. Budete s ním pravděpodobně narážet na různé problémy (pramenící z node.js, npm, slabší podpory Facebooku v jeho opensource knihovnách...), které byste na OSX nebo Linuxu nikdy řešit nemuseli. Předem se tak omlouvám, pokud vám občas něco nebude fungovat. <strong>Články totiž primárně počítají s OSX (či Linuxem)</strong>. Budu ovšem moc rád, pokud případné opravy či návody pošlete pull requestem.</p>\\n<h2>Prohlížeč<a id=\\\"prohl-e-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Standardem pro vývoj je Google Chrome</strong>, který má dnes asi nejpropracovanější vývojářské nástroje. Otevřete je zkratkou <code>⌘</code>+<code>alt</code>+<code>j</code>. <strong>Vůbec nejdůležitějším panelem je <code>Console</code></strong>. Mějte ho pořád na očích. JavaScript vám do něj bude vypisovat všechny warningy a errory. Také si do něj můžete logovat hodnoty vlastní pomocí funkce <code>console.log(...)</code>, která přehledně vypíše i komplikované datové struktury, což je fajn pro rychlé ladění.</p>\\n<p>Druhým nejužitečnějším panelem je <code>Elements</code>. <strong>Můžete v něm procházet a hlavně upravovat aktuální DOM strukturu a kaskádové styly.</strong> Změny se pak okamžitě projeví v okně prohlížeče. Hodí se třeba i pro ujištění, zda vám JavaScript vyrendroval nějakou komponentu a není třeba jen schovaná kvůli špatnému stylování.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/chrome.png\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Chrome s otevřenou konzolí\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Další panely už budete používat asi méně. Velmi šikovný je <code>Network</code>, ve kterém si můžete přehledně například vyfiltrovat XHR requesty. V <code>Sources</code> pak můžete debugovat pomocí breakpointů. Doinstalovat si můžete i speciální <a href=\\\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en\\\">panel pro React</a>. Je podobný <code>Elements</code>, ale poskytuje i informace o stavu React komponent. Nicméně reálně ho moc nepoužívám.</p>\\n<p>V nastavení vývojářských nástroju si ještě zkontrolujte, že máte zaškrtnuté <code>Enable CSS source maps</code> a <code>Enable JavaScript source maps</code>. V našich projektech nebudeme používat přímo JavaScript, ale Babel, který se do něho překládá. <strong>Source mapa pak umožní prohlížeči namapovat řádky výsledného JavaScriptu na zdrojový Babel</strong> a my se tak dozvíme správný řádek a soubor, kde došlo k chybě. Obdobně to funguje pro CSS a preprocesory jako je LESS.</p>\\n<p>Web nakonec musíte samozřejmě pravidelně testovat i v ostatních prohlížečích. I ty mají vlastní vývojařské nástroje. Pokud se vám tedy stane, že vám něco nefunguje pouze ve Firefoxu, nebojte se je vyzkoušet. Jsou velmi podobné těm v Chromu.</p>\\n<h2>Sublime Text<a id=\\\"sublime-text\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Zatímco mezi webovými prohlížeči moc na výběr nemáte, <strong>o dobré textové editory není nouze</strong>. Nemá smysl zde dělat nějaké dogmatické závěry. Někomu bude vyhovovat spartánský VIM a někdo má zase rád velké všeobjímající IDE. I tak se mezi JavaScriptovými vývojáři dá vypozorovat několik oblíbenců. <strong>Jedním z nich je editor <a href=\\\"http://www.sublimetext.com/\\\">Sublime Text</a>.</strong> Momentálně ho používám jako svůj hlavní editor pro všechno.</p>\\n<p>Jeho největší předností je rychlost, jednoduchost, spolehlivost a obrovská paleta všemožných doplňků. Nevýhodou pak je to, že se jedná o one-man show projekt, který autor trochu zanedbává, nicméně nedávno se mu zas začal věnovat. Jak už to bývá, dobré věci nejsou zadarmo a tak vás licence vyjde na rozumných $70. Lze ho však nějaký čas používat a zkoušet zdarma. Nejvíce ho totiž oceníte až po nějaké době, kdy si zapamatujete různé zkratky a využijete tak jeho maximální potenciál.</p>\\n<p>Pokud se ho rozhodnete používat pro vývoj webovek, doporučuji si pro začátek <a href=\\\"https://packagecontrol.io/installation\\\">stáhnout a nainstalovat</a> tyto doplňky:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/alienhard/SublimeAllAutocomplete\\\">All Autocomplete</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/BoundInCode/AutoFileName\\\">AutoFileName</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime\\\">Babel</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/editorconfig-sublime\\\">EditorConfig</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/miguelgraz/FocusFileOnSidebar\\\">Focus File On Sidebar</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git\\\">Git</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements\\\">Sidebar Enhancements</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3\\\">Sublime Linter</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>V některém z dalším článku popíšu, jak a proč si nastavit ESLint neboli kontrolu kódu pro JavaScript (Babel) a JSX přímo v Sublime Textu.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/sublime.png\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Sublime Text 3\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Dalším editorem, který stojí za pozornost je <a href=\\\"https://atom.io/\\\">Atom</a></strong>. Je to open source projekt, za kterým stojí GitHub a velmi připomíná Sublime Text. Má ale jeden problém a to je stabilita. Není zatím tak &quot;uhlazený&quot; jako ST a to je u nástroje, který používáte prakticky pořád, dost nepříjemné. Čas od času ho i přesto zkouším a jsou tam vidět velké pokroky. Také nad ním vznikají nové nástavby jako je <a href=\\\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\\\">Visual Studio Code</a> od Microsoftu nebo <a href=\\\"http://nuclide.io/\\\">Nuclide</a> od Facebooku. Budoucnost Atomu vypadá zajímavě.</p>\\n<p>Hodně přívrženců pak má i <a href=\\\"https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/\\\">WebStorm</a>, <a href=\\\"https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/\\\">PHPStorm</a> a celá rodina editorů postavená nad IntelliJ. <strong>Pokud máte rádi velké plnohodnotné IDE, které už v základu lecos umí, tak rozhodně stojí za zkoušku</strong>. Na psaní kódu se dá ale používat prakticky cokoliv, takže se nebojte experimentovat.</p>\\n<h2>Terminál<a id=\\\"termin-l\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Svatou trojici pak uzavírá terminál. <strong>Prohlížeč, textový editor a terminál jsou tři věci, které musíte mít jako vývojář stále na očích</strong>. Kromě základní práce se soubory a Gitem z něho budete spouštět vývojový server, buildovat produkční verze a sledovat případné warningy a errory v kódu. Obzvlášť s používáním hot reloadu se většina hlášení bude objevovat právě zde a nikoliv v Console logu prohlížeče.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/terminal.png\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"OSX Terminal\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Node.js a Npm<a id=\\\"node-js-a-npm\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>O <a href=\\\"https://nodejs.org/\\\">node.js</a> jste už určitě všichni slyšeli. Jistého chytrého člověka napadlo vzít JavaScript runtime z Chromu a postavit nad ním velmi výkonnou platformu, která by se dala používat i mimo prohlížeč a to zejména na serverech. Tento nápad se setkal s obrovským ohlasem a pomohl odstartovat to pravé JavaScriptové šílenství.</p>\\n<p>Asi není překvapivé, že <strong>node se tak stává přirozenou volbou (nejen) pro aplikace, které závisí na velkém JS frontendu</strong>. Je totiž velmi výhodné používat stejný jazyk na obou březích. Můžete tak snadno sdílet části kódu (například validační pravidla či routing), či si předrendrovat stránku už na serveru a uživateli poslat rovnou hotové HTML. Navíc i pokud se rozhodnete stavět server nad jinou platformou, tak se nodu nevyhnete kvůli vývojářským nástrojům, které jsou téměř výhradně napsané také v JavaScriptu. <strong>Takže si ho prosím rovnou nainstalujte</strong>.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 300px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/npm.png\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"NPM logo\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>S nodem se vám nainstaluje i <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/\\\">npm</a> - balíčkovací manager</strong>. Jde o ultimátní a jednotné řešení pro sdílení kódů napříč JS ekosystémem. Původně byl určen pro prostředí nodu, ale nakonec se z něj stal i jednotný systém pro frontend vývojáře (R.I.P <a href=\\\"http://bower.io/\\\">bower</a>). Používá ho tak node, browserify, webpack, gulp, grunt, Angular, jQuery, React, prohlížeče ... prostě všichni.</p>\\n<p><strong>Největší předností a odlišností NPM (například od Boweru) je to, že každý balíček může mít své vlastní závislosti (balíčky)</strong>. Vzniká tak strom závislostí a není problém, aby v jednom projektu běžela jedna knihovna v několika verzích. Tedy, občas to problém být může. Například React bude dost nešťastný, pokud bude muset o správu DOMu bojovat s další instancí Reactu. Aneb vůči dependency hellu není a nebude zcela imunní žádný balíčkovací manager, ale NPM si v porovnání s konkurencí vede víc než obstojně. <strong>Dalším fundamentálním rysem je filosofie malých a jednoúčelových balíčků</strong>. Není tedy nic zvláštního, pokud je balíček pouze jedna několikařádková funkce.</p>\\n<h2>Grunt<a id=\\\"grunt\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Se vší tou záplavou růných nástrojů, kompilátorů a linterů je potřeba se nějak vypořádat</strong>. Představte si, že byste po každé změně kódu museli vlézt do terminálu, najít změněný soubor, spustit nad ním Babel, poté ESLint a pak v prohlížeči ještě udělat refresh. To je přeci repetativní úkon, který se může zautomatizovat. <strong>Objevily se tak nástroje označované jako &quot;task runnery&quot;</strong>. Velmi populárním byl (a stále je?) <a href=\\\"http://gruntjs.com/\\\">Grunt</a>. Do projektu si přidáte <code>Gruntfile</code>, ve kterém si vše můžete nakonfigurovat. Konfigurace se skládá z jednotlivých tasků, které můžete pak volat v různém pořadí. Jednotlivé tasky (moduly) nemusíte psát sami, ale většinou je už najdete hotové na NPM. Jsou jich tisíce. Výsledek může vypadat třeba takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">module<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>grunt<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n\\n  grunt<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >initConfig<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    jshint<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n      files<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'Gruntfile.js'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> 'src<span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/**/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >*</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>js<span class=\\\"token string\\\" >', '</span>test<span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">/**/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >*</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>js'<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n      options<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n        globals<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n          jQuery<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token primitive\\\" >true</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    watch<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n      files<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'&lt;%= jshint.files %>'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n      tasks<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'jshint'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >]</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n  grunt<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >loadNpmTasks<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'grunt-contrib-jshint'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  grunt<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >loadNpmTasks<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'grunt-contrib-watch'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n  grunt<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >registerTask<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'default'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >[</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'jshint'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >]</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p><strong>Postupně se však ukázalo, že cesta &quot;vše konfigurovat&quot; není úplně nejšťastnější</strong>. Bez dokumentace totiž nedáte ani ránu a pokud si nevystačíte s předem danými funkcemi, tak máte problém. <strong>Dalším problémem Gruntu je rychlost</strong>. Mezivýsledky si totiž ukládá do filesystému a u větších projektů s komplikovaným build procesem trvá dlouho (tohle už možná nejnovější verze nějak řeší).</p>\\n<h2>Gulp<a id=\\\"gulp\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>A tak přibyl mladší bráška <a href=\\\"http://gulpjs.com/\\\">Gulp</a>, který se ponaučil z Gruntu a jde na to lépe</strong>. Konfigurace aka <code>Gulpfile</code> je JavaScript. <strong>Místo toho, abyste konfigurovali, tak programujete</strong>, což je velmi flexibilní a také odpadá nutnost spoléhat na dokumentace. Dalším zlepšovákem jsou streamy, které Gulp používá. Mezivýsledky si drží v paměti, vše běží paralelně a především citelně rychleji. Občas je však problém zkrotit tasky tak, aby běžely sekvenčně (verze 4.x tento častý problém adresuje). Tak jako Grunt i Gulp má dnes již téměř nekonečné množství pluginů. <strong>Grunt vs Gulp? Rozhodně Gulp</strong>. Pro názornost, &quot;konfigurace&quot; Gulpu může vypada třeba takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> gulp <span class=\\\"token operator\\\"

Zdrojáku</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Browserify<a id=\\\"browserify\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Node.js zavedlo do světa JS snadný způsob jak kód modularizovat. Takový modulární systém potřebuje dvě primární věci: možnost exportovat a importovat. Výše jste si mohli již povšimnout importování:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> gulp <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >require<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'gulp'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p>Obdobný zápis v ES6:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> gulp from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'gulp'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p>Výše uvedené zkusí prohledat <code>/node_modules</code> ve vašem projektu - místo, kam se vám budou ukládat balíčky z npm. Stačí zavolat <code>npm install gulp --save</code> a máte ho tam. Přepínač <code>--save</code> ho navíc přidá do seznamu v <code>package.json</code>. Běžně se totiž <code>/node_modules</code> adresář v Gitu ignoruje a tak je někde potřeba uchovávat seznam všech závislostí.</p>\\n<p>V <code>/node_modules/gulp</code> se pak import podívá do hlavního souboru daného balíčku a v něm najde export:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> inst <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >new</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >Gulp</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\nmodule<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> inst<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p><strong>To je vše pěkné, ale asi vás teď napadlo, jak to bude fungovat v prohlížeči? Nebude.</strong> Do prohlížeče můžeme jednotlivé skripty nahrávat pomocí <code>&lt;script&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt;</code>, ale to nám moc nepomůže. Podobných souborů totiž budeme mít v projektu stovky až tisíce a posílat tolik HTTP requestů rozhodně nemůžeme. <strong>Také to nijak neřeší potřebu verzování, minimalizování a zapouzdřování</strong>. Tyto závislosti je tedy potřeba vyřešit už před releasem a uživateli posílat jeden výsledný soubor, ve kterém bude jen to, co skutečně potřebuje.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width: 250px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/browserify.png\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Magické Browserify\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>A tak vzniklo <a href=\\\"http://browserify.org/\\\">Browserify</a></strong>. Vezme váš kód a vyřeší všechny <code>require</code> a <code>module.exports</code> a vyplivne jeden výsledný soubor. <strong>JavaScript, který byl původně určen pro node.js, dokáže udělat kompatibilní pro prohlížeče</strong>. Poradí si například i s core node.js knihovnami. Nicméně to má samozřejmě jistá omezení. Například nemůžete pracovat s <code>fs</code> (filesystem). Velkým plusem je, že není potřeba nic konfigurovat - jednoduše to bude fungovat. Všechna magie se děje uvnitř. Ne nadarmo má ve znaku kouzelnický klobouk.</p>\\n<h2>Webpack<a id=\\\"webpack\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Browserify funguje opravdu pěkně, ale i tak má přeci jen pár mušek</strong>. Řeší totiž jenom JavaScript a vše ostatní je potřeba doplnit spoustou gulp modulů. Navíc se ukázalo, že <strong>kromě JavaScriptu je potřeba podobně zpracovat i CSS</strong> (v praxi například LESS) nebo obrázky. To by nemuselo s Gulpem a jeho tisíci pluginy vadit, že? Bohužel Gulp má jednu zásadní slabinu, která plyne ze streamování. Neumí úplně přímočaře vytvořit z několika souborů jeden výstupní (s tím se umí lépe vypořádat např. undergroundovější task runner <a href=\\\"http://broccolijs.com/\\\">Broccoli</a>). Je tak potřeba v gulp tascích řešit trochu nešikovně bundlování. A z toho zase mohou vznikat další obtíže, jako je správné odchytávání a zobrazování chyb. Dá se s tím poprat, ale budete cítit, že to není úplně ono.</p>\\n<p><strong><a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/\\\">Webpack</a> na to jde úplně jinak, tak trochu proti filosofii celého JS ekosystému</strong>. Nedeleguje a nevyčleňuje jednotlivé funkce do více modulů a tak už v základu představuje velmi mocný nástroj. Nástroj, který byl od počátku zamýšlen tak, aby nám vývojářům co nejvíce usnadnil práci. <strong>Základním stavebním kamenem jsou loadery</strong>. Každý formát má vlastní a může jít téměř o cokoliv (.js, .css, .less, .coffee, .png...). Webpack pak přetíží <code>require()</code> volání a můžete ho použít třeba i pro markdown dokumenty (jako tato stránka). Následně pak funguje podobně jako browserify, tedy vyřeší závislosti a sestaví build, ve kterém je jen to potřebné.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/webpack.png\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Webpack proces\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Oproti browserify je potřeba ho nakonfigurovat, což není úplně jednoduché</strong>. Na druhou stranu, jakmile to jednou uděláte, získáte velmi mocného společníka. Konfiguraci navíc můžete z velké části obšlehnout. <strong>Poskytuje také jednu killer funkci</strong>, kterou browserify nemá a pro kterou se vyplatí na něj z browserify přejít a tím je <strong>hot module replacement</strong>. Dokáže nahradit a zpracovat modul, aniž by bylo potřeba refreshovat celou stránku (a modul může být javascript, less nebo markdown!). Bez jakýchkoliv dodatečných pluginů v prohlížeči. Pouze čistý JavaScript! To ohromně zefektivňuje vývoj.</p>\\n<p>Dobré je také zmínit, že <strong>kdykoliv můžete velmi snadno přejít z browserify na webpack</strong> (bez úprav zdrojáků). Udělal jsem to nedávno u projektu s 10 000 řádky kódu a 70 npm moduly bez jediné upravy mimo konfiguraci webpacku a gulpu. Naopak už to vždy jít nemusí (pokud například budete specifikovat loadery inline přímo v require voláních).</p>\\n<h2>ESLint<a id=\\\"eslint\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Lintování je levný způsob, jak zlepšit stav zdrojáků napříč větším projektem či týmem několika programátorů</strong>. Hlídá totiž styl, jakým kód píšete a tak musí všichni stejně odsazovovat nebo používat závorky. <strong>Pravidla, podle kterých se řídí, si samozřejmě můžete libovolně nastavit</strong>. Nebude vám podstrkovat nějaký svůj styl. Krom toho, že hlídá úhlednost a jednotnost kódu, tak vám leckdy pomůže odhalit i různé překlepy či nepoužíváné importy. <a href=\\\"http://eslint.org/\\\">ESLint</a> je poměrně nový JS linter (2013), který si vzal ponaučení z JSHintu a je kompletně modulární. Můžete si do něj tedy přidávat různé doplňky. <strong>Například se vám bude jistě hodit podpora React JSX či Babelu</strong>. Lintování si můžete nainstalovat přímo do svého editoru a zároveň ho přidat i do build procesu, což je taková případná obrana před vývojářem, který by se rozhodl pravidla porušit.</p>\\n<h2>Závěrem<a id=\\\"z-v-rem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Tento článek byl především seznamovací a většina z vás v něm asi nenalezla mnoho nového. I tak je ale důležité udělat alespoň rychlý přehled o různých nástrojích a technologiích, které se dnes používají. <strong>V JS světě se budete neustále potýkat s tím, že žádná řešení nejsou ultimátní</strong> a i ta, která jsou zrovna na špici, mohou za půl roku upadnout zcela v zapomnění. A tak tu máme několik kvalitních prohlížečů, editorů, task runnerů, bundlerů, linterů a dokonce i &quot;JavaScript jazyků&quot;.</p>\\n<p>Ale nebojte, příště už to bude rozhodně zajímavější! Vyhrneme si rukávy a pustíme se konečně do práce. <strong>Ukážeme si, jak to vše poskládat dohromady a napíšeme si první React komponentu!</strong></p>\\n\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./content/Nastroje/index.md\n ** module id = 127\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"<h1>React - JSX<a id=\\\"react-jsx\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p>První věc, která nováčka v Reactu rozhodně praští do očí, je zápis XML (HTML) tagů přímo do JavaScriptového kódu bez apostrofů kolem. Takovýto zápis se ve světě Reactu nazývá JSX a ano, není to validní JS syntax. Před spuštěním se musí do JS kompilovat. <strong>Dnes si ukážeme, co je pod pokličkou JSX a že se vlastně není čeho bát</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Šablonovací systémy<a id=\\\"-ablonovac-syst-my\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Pojem &quot;šablonovací systém&quot; vám asi není neznámý. V oblasti webů má za úkol oddělit kód (např. PHP) od popisu struktury stránky. Známé příklady jsou Latte, Smarty nebo Twig. Ve světě JavaScriptu pak <a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/\\\">Closure Templates (Soy)</a>. Šablony obsahují jeden velký řetězec plný HTML, CSS a JS + nějaké speciální zápisy (proměnné, makra...). Šablonovací systém pak pomocí regulárních výrazů naplní šablonu daty a poslepuje z ní výsledný řetězec, který může poslat do prohlížeče. Skutečný proces může být i o něco složitější, ale princip zůstává stejný - <strong>jde o slepování řetězců</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>DOM vs řetězce<a id=\\\"dom-vs-et-zce\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Slepování řetězců funguje dobře na straně serveru, protože s reloadem celé stránky odpadá starost o stav stránky (například co bylo vyplněné ve formuláři) a vše se načte a spustí znova. <strong>Jenže co dělat, když chceme chceme aktualizovat jenom malé výseky stránky pomocí DOMu?</strong> Můžeme nad upravovaným DOM elementem zavolat:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Element</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>innerHTML <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'&lt;div>Komponenta, kterou jsme aktualizovali&lt;/div>'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p>Problém vyřešen. Naše šablony (řetězce) můžeme takto vložit na libovolné místo DOMu a navíc je to ještě velmi rychlé. Má to ale zásadní háček.</p>\\n<p><strong>Pokud by naše komponenta měla na sobě pověšené listenery (například onClick), tak ty po innerHTML zmizí a musíme je opětovně navěsit.</strong> Co když bude v naší komponentě formulář a uživatel v něm bude mít zrovna něco rozepsané? Všechno mu během aktualizace zmizí. Aktualizování DOMu pomocí innerHTML je sice velmi rychlé, ale také velmi náchylné k chybám. Navíc si to přímo říká o XSS .</p>\\n<p>A tak vývojáři raději mění DOM postupně pomocí bezpečnějších metod typu <code>Node.appendChild()</code> či <code>Node.replaceChild()</code>. Problém vyřešen? Ne tak docela. Pěkné řetězcové šablony, kde na první pohled vidíme strukturu komponent, už nám najednou nestačí a naše zdrojáky musíme doplnit o různě dlouhé série <code>Node</code> metod, což je typické imperativní nepřehledné programování. <strong>Místo toho, abychom definovali jednotlivé stavy (podoby) našich komponent, musíme dávat dohromady sady kroků, kterými se z jednoho stavu dostaneme do druhého.</strong> Kdyby tak byla nějaká knihovna, která by tohle za nás vyřešila. Třeba React, že.</p>\\n<h2>Funkce místo řetězců<a id=\\\"funkce-m-sto-et-zc-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Definice komponent pomocí řetězců má tedy své limity. React však používá silnější nástroj - virtuální DOM (strom), který si vytvoří na základě <strong><code>render()</code> metod, které popisují strukturu komponent pomocí funkcí</strong>. Tento virtuální DOM se spak pomocí <code>appendChild</code> či <code>innerHTML</code> promítne do DOMu skutečného a dojde tak k překreslení v prohlížeči. Pokud se u některé komponenty změní props nebo state, opětovně se zavolá metoda <code>render()</code>, vznikne nový virtuální DOM, porovná se s tím s předchozím a rozdíly mezi němi se nejefektivnějším možným způsobem promítnou opět i do DOMu skutečného.</p>\\n<p><strong>Jak se ale HTML dá převést na funkce?</strong> Názvy jednotlivých elementů nahradíme za názvy funkcí a z atributů (props) uděláme jeden velký argument - mapu. Vnořené elementy (děti) pak budou představovat další argumenty (mimochodem v React komponentě jsou přístupné pomocí <code>this.props.children</code>).</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>form className<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"nameForm\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>input type<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"text\\\"</span> placeholder<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"Jméno\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>input type<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"text\\\"</span> placeholder<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"Příjmení\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>input type<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"submit\\\"</span> value<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"Poslat\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>form<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span></code><p>se zapíše jako:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >form<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>className<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'nameForm'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >input<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>type<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'text'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> placeholder<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'Jméno'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >input<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>type<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'text'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> placeholder<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'Příjmení'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >input<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>type<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'submit'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> value<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'Poslat'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span></code><p><strong>A to je celá věda kolem JSX.

Výjimku udělá, pokud použijete prefix <code>data-</code>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div data<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>attr<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"test\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span></code><p>Občas také můžete mít potřebu vložit někam &quot;natvrdo&quot; statický HTML kód, to se udělá takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div dangerouslySetInnerHTML<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>__html<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'&lt;b>Tohle se neescapuje!&lt;/b>'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span></code><p>Z názvu je už zřejmé, že jde o velmi nebezpečný postup, protože escapování zůstává jen a pouze na vás. Tímto úplně vyřadíte React a obsah se do stránky vloží pomocí <code>innerHTML</code>.</p>\\n<h2>Chyby<a id=\\\"chyby\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Jednou z velkých výhod definování pomocí funkcí je to, že <strong>pokud uděláte chybu, dostane se vám vždy pěkné a přesné zprávy</strong>, protože jste udělali chybu v JavaScriptovém kódu a nikoliv v nějakém řetězci, který se bude parsovat až buhví kdy.</p>\\n<p>Například chybějící uzavírací závorka:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div className<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"timeago\\\"</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Time</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Ago</span> date<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>article<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>date<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> formatter<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>formatter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span></code><p>okamžitě vypíše tuto pěknou chybu v terminálu:</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/error.png\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Pěkné a přehledné chybové hlášení\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>To je luxus, který se vám většinou při &quot;slepování řetězců&quot; nedostane.</p>\\n<p>Některé atributy se jmenují jinak kvůli kolizím s klíčovými slovy.

React však můžete plnohodnotně používat i zcela bez něj. <strong>Důležité je však to, co se skrývá pod ním - funkce.</strong> Funkce totiž poskytují skvělou a netušeně mocnou abstrakci pro skládání jednotlivých komponent. I po 2 letech od uvedení Reactu se tak stále objevují nové a lepší způsoby, jakými do sebe jednotlivé komponenty skládat, což si určitě ukážeme i v dalších dílech. To by nebylo možné, pokud by React a JSX nebyly pouze čistým JavaScriptem. Příště si ukážeme knihovnu <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/\\\">Immutable.js</a> a způsob jak díky ní 100x zrychlit už tak rychlou React aplikaci.</p>\\n\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./content/React-jsx/index.md\n ** module id = 128\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"<h1>React - Props vs State<a id=\\\"react-props-vs-state\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p><strong>React se točí kolem props a tak je nejvyšší čas si ukázat, co jsou zač</strong>. Minule jsem už naznačil, že jde o druhý zdroj dat, který React komponenty pro své vykreslení používají. Povíme si, jak se props liší od state a jakým způsobem se používají. To vše si demonstrujeme na pokročilejším příkladě, který se bude skládat z více komponent. Na nich uvidíte i to, jakým způsobem se komponenty do sebe skládají a jak spolu komunikují. <strong>Dnes to bude o úplných základech Reactu</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Props<a id=\\\"props\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>React komponenty lze do sebe skládat</strong> a proto je potřeba, aby měly prostředek pro předávání dat. Tím jsou právě ony props, které tak tvoří páteř všech React aplikací.</p>\\n<p>V hlavní React komponentě můžeme mít metodu:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >return<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Zv</span>ířata<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Animal</span> name<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"Baryk\\\"</span> type<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"dog\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Animal</span> name<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"Lizza\\\"</span> type<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"cat\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Animal je přitom jen další React komponenta</strong>. Ta tímto získala přístup k <code>this.props.name</code> a <code>this.props.type</code>. Její <code>render</code> metoda může vypadat třeba takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >return<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Zv</span>íře<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>h1<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Jm</span>éno<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>name<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Typ</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>props<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>type<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Předávat můžeme samozřejmě i funkce či objekty. Všechno je jen a pouze čistý JavaScript. Props fungují pouze jednosměrně směrem zhora dolů.</strong> Zvíře tudíž nemá způsob, jak změnit props komponenty Zvířata. Může nicméně dostat od rodičovské komponenty skrz props callback a ten zavolat. Tento jednosměrný postup velmi redukuje komplexnost aplikací.</p>\\n<p>Už víte, že <code>render()</code> se volá při změně props a state. <strong>S jeho voláním se ale navíc přerendruje i celý podstrom potomků.</strong> Pokud by někdo změnil state/props v komponentě Zvířata, tak se zavolají <code>render</code> metody i u komponenty Zvíře.</p>\\n<h2>Zadání úlohy<a id=\\\"zad-n-lohy\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Dnešním cílem bude vytvoření jednoduché databáze aut</strong>. Každé auto bude mít 3 údaje - značku, model a rok výroby. Tyto údaje budou seskupené do karty, která bude umožňovat (roz)skrýt model a rok. Jednotlivá auta budeme moct přidávat a mazat.</p>\\n<h2>Návrh komponent<a id=\\\"n-vrh-komponent\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Při navrhování React aplikací začínáme tím, že si musíme aplikaci rozkouskovat do jednotlivých komponent</strong>. Při rozdělování do komponent se lze přidržet i vizuální podoby. Logickým kandidátem na samostatnou komponentu je karta auta. Další částí rozhraní je formulář pro přidání auta, šup s ním do druhé komponenty. Nakonec potřebujeme ještě někde formulář a auta vypsat a máme tak komponentu třetí - hlavní.</p>\\n<h2>Kam se stavem<a id=\\\"kam-se-stavem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Jaké stavy v aplikaci vlastně budeme mít? Jde především o detaily aut</strong>. Vhodným kandidátem pro uložení je pole objektů, kde každý objekt bude reprezentovat jedno auto. Ale kam s ním? V naší jednoduché aplikaci moc na výběr nemáme. Pole aut musí být v hlavní komponentě, která jednotlivá auta bude vykreslovat.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dalším stavem pak bude to, zda je karta auta rozbalená či zabalená.</strong> Asi vás ihned napadne, že tento stav patří do komponenty auta. Také ho ale můžeme umístit jako další vlasnost objektu auto. Oba přístupy jsou v pohodě.</p>\\n<p>Nicméně, obecným <strong>trendem v React aplikacích je zahnat veškeré stavy někam &quot;do rohu&quot; na jedno místo</strong>. Proč nechceme mít stavy roztroušené po aplikaci? Tak například si představte, že bychom chtěli přidat tlačítko &quot;Rozbal všechna auta&quot;. Podobnou funkcionalitu bychom přirozeně umístili do hlavní komponenty, ale jak pak aktualizovat tento stav v jednotlivých komponentách aut? Není způsob jak komponenty aut proiterovat a zavolat <code>auto.rozbalit()</code>, protože to by byl imperativní přístup, který v Reactu (naštěstí) nefunguje.</p>\\n<p><strong>Komponentu s vnitřním stavem nemůžeme 100% ovládat z vnějšího prostředí</strong>. Pokud však stav vystrčíme někam ven a komponeta bude používat pro své vykreslování pouze zděděné props, dostaneme nad ní plnou kontrolu.</p>\\n<p><strong>Lokální stav je tedy přijatelný pouze, pokud ho nikdy nebudeme potřebovat upravovat či číst vně komponenty</strong>. Nicméně i takovýto superlokální stav můžeme snadno &quot;globalizovat&quot; a mít tak všechny React komponenty &quot;čisté&quot; a plně kontrolovatelné. To si však ukážeme až později s Flux architekturou. A nebojte, je globální stav a globální stav.</p>\\n<h2>Komponenta Auto<a id=\\\"komponenta-auto\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Nejlepším postupem je budovat aplikaci od spoda</strong>, jelikož pak můžete rychle vše testovat, což je vždy lepší než půl hodiny psát kód naslepo. Napíšeme si tedy nejdříve komponentu auto. Představíme si, jak asi bude vypadat objekt auta, který dostaneme skrz props:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>id<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\"

mazání a rozbalování. <code>details</code> nám pak určuje, zda je karta rozbalená či zabalená.</p>\\n<p>Začneme tím, že si data vypíšeme:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token

metodě <code>render()</code> není mnoho zajímavého. Za zmínku stojí, že <strong>občas jsou některé atributy v JSX přejmenované</strong>. Například <code>for</code> na <code>htmlFor</code>, či <code>class</code> na <code>className</code>. To proto, aby nedocházelo ke kolizím s klíčovými slovy JS. Pokud byste na to však zapomněli, tak vám React poradí v konzoli. React je velmi výřečný co se warningů a errorů týče, což je dobře.</p>\\n<p>Formulář má na sobě pověšený listener <code>onSubmit</code>, který po odeslání zavolá příslušnou metodu. <strong>V ní musíme ihned zavolat <code>e.preventDefault()</code></strong>, jinak by došlo k redirectu aneb standardní chování prohlížeče.</p>\\n<p><strong>Důležitým atributem je <code>ref</code></strong>. Ten se hodí, pokud si chceme &quot;šáhnout&quot; na skutečný DOM element. V JSX si ho pomocí tohoto atributu označkujeme a pak se k němu díky <code>React.findDOMNode(this.refs.foo)</code> můžeme dostat. Vidíte, že k hodnotám formuláře přistupujeme velmi nízkoúrovňově, nepotřebujeme žádnou komplikovanou a zbytečnou abstrakci.</p>\\n<p><strong>V našem příkladě používáme &quot;nekontrolované&quot; vstupní elementy</strong>. Toto je totiž jediná výjimka, kdy React na chvílí přihmouří oči a nechá vás měnit hodnoty v DOMu (value v inputech), aniž by do toho jakkoliv zasahoval. <strong>Existuje však druhý &quot;kontrolovaný&quot; přístup</strong>.

Není to úplně hezké řešení, ale nám to pro tuto chvíli stačí. Lepší by bylo nemít auta v poli, ale v objektu (mapě) a přistupovat k nim přímo pomocí <code>id</code>.

Přibyl atribut <code>key={car.id}</code>. Ten slouží čistě potřebám Reactu, aby měl přehled o tom, které elementy v budoucím rendrování zmizí či se jen přemístí. Může pak lépe optimalizovat. Pokud byste <code>key</code> neuvedli, tak vám v konzoli React vynadá, ale kód bude stále funkční.</p>\\n<p><strong>Dílo je u konce.

Navíc si představte, pokud byste měli v sobě zanořených třeba 5 komponent a museli byste si pořád vše předávat skrz props. <strong>Chybí nám tu ono M a C, chybí nám tu zatím Flux</strong>. Dalším nedostatkem je nepoužívání immutable kolekcí, které přinášejí optimalizaci velkou jako Brno. A samozřejmě <strong>formulář by také zasloužil více lásky</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Závěrem<a id=\\\"z-v-rem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Dnes jsme si naprogramovali složitější aplikaci a názorně si demonstrovali základní práci s Reactem.</strong> Páteří každé React aplikace jsou props a předávání dat skrz ně. Při vytváření nových stavů je potřeba velká obezřetnost, protože nám mohou značně zkomplikovat celou aplikaci. Je dobré stavy &quot;vyhnat&quot; na jedno místo, ideálně do root komponenty. <strong>Příště se mrkneme do hloubky na JSX a ukážeme si, že lze používat React i bez něj.</strong></p>\\n\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./content/React-props-vs-state/index.md\n ** module id = 129\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"<h1>React - Úvod<a id=\\\"react-vod\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p><strong>React je JavaScriptová knihovna pro vytváření webových komponent.</strong> V pomyslném MVC představuje &quot;V&quot; neboli view vrstvu a dal by se tak přirovnat například Latte v Nette. React je však daleko více. Přináší totiž zásadní změnu paradigmatu. S Reactem už nepíšeme kód, který něco mění, ale kód, který popisuje, jak má vypadat výsledek, což je řádově snažší úloha. Dvojnásob to pak platí, pokud tím výsledkem je &quot;těžká váha&quot; v podobě DOMu.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width:300px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/logo.png\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"JS knihoven není nikdy dost\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n<h2>Trocha historie<a id=\\\"trocha-historie\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>React spatřil světlo světa v květnu 2013</strong>. Opensourcoval ho Facebook, který ho už několik let před tím sám interně používal a vylepšoval. Prvotní vydání se však dočkalo velkého výsměchu. Odezva byla dokonce tak špatná, že Facebook chvíli uvažoval i o jeho stáhnutí. Terčem kritiky se stalo především míchání &quot;HTML a programování&quot;. Podobné obavy nedávno vyjádřili i někteří <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/geekovo/status/604710448131391490\\\">prominentní čeští webaři</a>. Postupně se však ukázalo, že došlo k pouze nepochopení základního konceptu a nejen FE vývojáři si začli rychle osvojovat a užívat nové fundamenty, které React přinesl.</p>\\n<p><strong>K dnešnímu dni</strong> (červenec 2015) <strong>má 4800 commitů, 25 000 stargazerů a 444 contributorů a je tak jedním z nejoblíbenějších a nejaktivnějších repozitářů na GitHubu</strong>. Facebook během této doby uvolnil i další JS projekty jako <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\\\">React Native</a> (React pro iOS a blíží se i vydání Android verze), <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/\\\">Immutable.js</a> (immutable kolekce) či <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\\\">Flux</a> (M a C doplňující React v pomyslném MVC).</p>\\n<p>Horkou novinkou je pak <a href=\\\"http://facebook.github.io/graphql/\\\">GraphQL</a>, což je dotazovací jazyk, kterým v komponentách popíšete, jaká data ze serveru potřebují. V srpnu 2015 pak vyjde <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/02/20/introducing-relay-and-graphql.html\\\">Relay</a>, který GraphQL bude umět na straně webu zpracovat a rýsuje se nám tak zajímavé řešení pro datovou komunikaci server-client, která dnes představuje nejtěžší část webové aplikace.</p>\\n<h2>Pořád jen Facebook<a id=\\\"po-d-jen-facebook\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Všechny výše uvedené projekty jsou široce používané a je kolem nich mohutná komunita. Nevezou se však na popularitě Reactu, protože s ním nejsou nijak spojené. Jsou prostě tak dobré. <strong>Facebook v posledních letech jednoznačně udává trendy v tvorbě webových aplikací</strong>. Nevytváří velké ucelené frameworky, ale pouze malé pragmatické knihovny s minimalistickým API, což má v JS ekosystému úspěch. Přístup Facebooku k opensource by měl být vzorem i pro další firmy.</p>\\n<p><strong>Druhým webovým hegemonem je Google</strong>, který ale v poslední době působí trochu schizofrenicky. Jakoby si každý jeho tým budoval vlastní framework/knihovnu a tak tu máme vedle sebe <a href=\\\"https://angularjs.org/\\\">Angular</a>, <a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/closure/\\\">Closure Tools</a> a <a href=\\\"https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/\\\">Polymer</a>. Alespoň už zařízl Dart a třeba tak více konsoliduje své síly, co se JS knihoven týče.</p>\\n<h2>Server vs prohlížeč<a id=\\\"server-vs-prohl-e-\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Klasické server-side webovky jsou vcelku jednoduché. <strong>Server totiž nemusí udržovat žádný stav</strong>. Přijde mu požadavek od uživatele, poslepuje dohromady nějaké řetězce (část z nich načte třeba z databáze) a celé to pak pošle uživateli do prohlížeče, který to rozparsuje a sestaví DOM (Document Object Model - stromová reprezetace toho co vidíte v prohlížeči jako HTML stránku + metody, kterými se dá upravovat či procházet).</p>\\n<p><strong>Interaktivní JS webovky, které běží v prohlížeči, jsou podstatně složitější</strong>. Chceme totiž po nich daleko více než od server-side aplikací. Chceme nabídnout daleko vyšší uživatelský zážitek. Je trochu zbytečné s každou akcí překreslovat celou stránku, když můžeme změny bleskově provádět pomocí funkcí DOMu a uživateli tak dopřát pohodlí, které zná z desktopových aplikací.</p>\\n<h2>Zlý DOM<a id=\\\"zl-dom\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>DOM a JavaScript jsou dvě úplně rozdílné věci</strong>. Teoreticky by mohl být DOM upravován i jiným jazykem, ale v praxi prohlížeče nabízejí pouze JavaScript. DOM je obrovský moloch, práce s ním je pomalá a prohlížeče nejsou vždy jednotné v jeho implementaci. <strong>JavaScript pak často neprávem sklízí nenávistné komentáře, které by ale měly směřovat právě na DOM</strong>. Dnešní JavaScript je naopak velmi rychlý a vcelku lišácky navržený, což ostatně potvrzuje i to, že se rozšiřuje i do oblastí, kde má narozdíl od prohlížečů silnou konkurenci (node.js).</p>\\n<p>DOM navíc představuje jednu velkou globální proměnnou, což přímo svádí k tomu, abychom ho používali jako místo pro ukládání stavu naší aplikace. Asi nemusím popisovat proč jsou globální proměnné zlo. U DOMu to pak ještě zhoršuje jeho pomalost. <strong>Stav aplikace bychom tedy měli udržovat jinde - v našem JavaScriptu</strong> a do DOMu šahat, jenom když je to skutečně potřeba. Pouze do něj zrcadlit změny z našeho JS kódu. Jenže jak to jednoduše udělat?</p>\\n<h2>Přínos Reactu<a id=\\\"p-nos-reactu\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Nejzřejmější výhoda pro začátečníka je ta, že React nás prakticky úplně odstíní od DOMu</strong>. V React komponentách pouze deklarativně zadefinujeme strukturu (HTML) skládáním JS funkcí. Jinými slovy, popíšeme, jak má vypadat výsledná stránka na základě příchozích dat. React si z toho poskládá svůj vlastní virtuální DOM, který pak pomocí chytrých algoritmů porovnává s tím skutečným DOMem a když najde rozdíly, tak ho nejefektivnějším možným způsobem aktualizuje. <strong>My už pak jenom dodáváme nová data do jednotlivých komponent a tím pro nás veškerá práce končí</strong>. V prohlížeči vždy uvidíte aktuální pohled vzhledem k dodaným datům. Tohle je &quot;deal breaker&quot;, který vám pravděpodobně není úplně zřejmý, pokud už nemáte předešlou trpkou zkušenost s imperativním přístupem u větší aplikace, což je typicky jQuery a fidlování s jednotlivými DOM elementy.</p>\\n<h2>Začínáme<a id=\\\"za-n-me\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Je načase si ukázat první příklad. Komponenty si budete moc vyzkoušet přímo v rámci této stránky nebo zkopírováním do svého <a href=\\\"prvni-dev-stack.html\\\">vymazleného stacku</a>. Najdete je samozřejmě také v <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tajo/javascript/tree/master/examples/react\\\">repozitáři</a>. Budu téměř výhradně používat novou čerstvě vydanou ES6 syntax.</p>\\n<p>Naše první komponenta se bude jmenovat <code>Counter</code> a <strong>bude udržovat a zobrazovat počet našich kliknutí</strong>. Hned se podívejte na výsledek:</p>\\n<p>$$$counter$$$</p>\\n<p>A teď si to pojďme rozebrat a naprogramovat. Jak už to bývá, ani u Reactu se neobejdme bez minimálního boilerplate kódu:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span> from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'react'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >default</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >class</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >Counter</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >extends</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>Component</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span></code><p><strong>Nikdy nesmíme zapomenout na importování Reactu</strong>. I když to není na první pohled zřejmé, tak ony HTML tagy (JSX) jsou ve skutečnosti převlečené funkce Reactu, ale to bychom teď předbíhali. Novou komponentu jednoduše oddědíme od <code>React.Component</code> a <code>export default class Counter</code> nám komponentu zpřístupní napříč celou aplikací.</p>\\n<p><strong>React komponenty mají pouze jednu povinnou metodu a to <code>render()</code></strong>. V ní se očekává, že popíšete strukturu komponenty včetně jejích závislostí na data. Metoda musí pak vrátit 1 root element (například <code>&lt;div/&gt;</code>), který už může mít libovolný počet potomků včetně dalších React komponent. Takhle vypadá ta naše:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Kliknul</span> jsi <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>state<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>counter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>x<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>br<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>button onClick<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>e<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span> <span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >handleClick<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>e<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Klikni</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >!</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>button<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Povšimněte si, že &quot;uprostřed&quot; JSX zápisu můžete opět vkládat JS výrazy</strong>, pokud je obalíte do <code>{}</code> a takhle to můžete prokladát do několika úrovní, pokud máte rádi nepřehledný kód. JSX velmi připomíná klasické HTML a rozdílů byste našli jen několik. Což je vcelku zajímavé, protože pod pokličkou jde o principálně zcela jinou věc.</p>\\n<p><code>this.state</code> je jeden ze dvou hlavních objektů, který &quot;krmí&quot; React komponenty daty. O tom druhém <code>this.props</code> a rozdílech si povíme až příště. <strong><code>this.state</code> je lokální stav komponenty, do kterého si můžeme ukládat libovolná data</strong>. Nám se hodí pro uložení počtu kliknutí. Pomocí <code>{this.state.counter}</code> si tento počet pak jednoduše vypíšeme.</p>\\n<p>Klikací tlačítko má atribut <code>onClick</code>. <strong>Vzpomínáte na poučku, že se nemají používat tyto inline atributy pro volání JS? Tak ta stále platí.</strong> Nicméně protože <code>&lt;button/&gt;</code> je ve skutečnosti JS funkce a ne HTML element, tak i <code>onClick</code> nemá s tím klasickým moc společného.</p>\\n<p>React má totiž propracované delegování eventů a tak i když budete mít v aplikaci tisíc onClicků, tak z nich React udělá jenom jeden, který pověsí na root element a příchozí eventy nechá probublat k patřičným odběratelům. To velmi šetří výkon a vám nervy, pokud byste podobnou (a nutnou) optimalizaci museli sami implementovat. V Reactu tak můžete libovolně &quot;plýtvat&quot; s listenery jako <code>onKeyDown</code>, <code>onCopy</code>, <code>onFocus</code>, <code>onScroll</code> ...

Musíme ho nejprve inicializovat a to se nemůže dít nikde jinde než v konstruktoru:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >constructor<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >super<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>state <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>counter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\" >0</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>Zbývá si už jen napsat funkci, která se zavolá kliknutím na naše tlačítko:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >handleClick<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>e<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >setState<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>previousState <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>counter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> previousState<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>counter <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >+</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\" >1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Stav komponenty se vždy a pouze mění pomocí metody <code>this.setState()</code></strong>. Vyvarujte se pokušení napsat <code>this.state =</code>, protože by se vám pak nezavolal <code>render()</code>. Do <code>setState</code> můžeme jako první argument předat přímo novou hodnotu stavu nebo funkci, do které dostaneme předchozí stav (a props), což se právě hodí pro inkrementování. Náš případ by šel zapsat i jako:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >handleClick<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>e<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >setState<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>counter<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token var\\\" >this</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>state<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>counter <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >+</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\" >1</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Kdy a jak probíhá překreslení?</strong> To už má plně v režii React. K zavolání metody <code>render()</code> dochází, pokud se změní <code>this.state</code> nebo <code>this.props</code>, případně, pokud zavoláme <code>forceUpdate()</code>. <strong>Metoda render vygeneruje nový virtuální DOM a porovná ho s tím skutečným v prohlížeči</strong>. Pokud najde nějaké změny, tak je nejefektivnějším způsobem aplikuje. Svižné a elegantní. Nikde jsme nemuseli definovat, jak, kdy a které DOM elementy je potřeba aktualizovat. <strong>Pouze jsme popsali strukturu a její vztah k datům.</strong></p>\\n<p>Výsledný kód:</p>\\n<code

id=\\\"z-v-rem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Představili jsme si React, jeho krátkou historii a související projekty</strong>. Jedním ze strašáků &quot;programování v prohlížeči&quot; je DOM, často chybně a neférově zaměňován s JavaScriptem. React nám mj. umožňuje téměř kompletní abstrakci od DOMu. Strukturu jednotlivých komponent zapisujeme (deklarujeme) skládáním React funkcí, kterým následně dodáváme data a tím pro nás práce končí. React toho nabízí samozřejmě daleko více. Nakousli jsme třeba i systém eventů. <strong>S Reactem je to tak trochu jako dobrým čajem nebo kafem</strong>. Zpočátku vám bude připadat divný a musíte se k němu postupně &quot;propít&quot;. Až poté se stane nepostradatelnou součástí vašeho programátorského dne.</p>\\n<p><strong>Příště si ukážeme, co jsou to <code>this.props</code> a jak se liší od <code>this.state</code></strong>. Také si více povíme o životním cyklu komponenty a jejích dalších metodách.</p>\\n\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./content/React-uvod/index.md\n ** module id = 130\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"<h1>První dev stack<a id=\\\"prvn-dev-stack\\\">&nbsp;</a></h1><p>Hlavním hrdinou dnešního článku se stane bundlovací nástroj webpack.

Na první pohled se možná nezdá jako kdoví co, ale vězte, že pod jeho pokličkou toho bublá daleko více. Běží totiž na moderním JS dev stacku, což je soubor různých knihoven, technik a nastavení. Je to základová deska pro náš rodinný baráček. Avšak s menší úpravou by zvládla unést i velký hrad. Co tedy od ní čekat?

Ale nebojte, nemusíte si kvůli tomu vyprázdnit kalendář na příští 3 měsíce.

Pro naše účely jsem stáhnul <a href=\\\"https://github.com/steida/este\\\">github.com/steida/este</a> a vyházel z něho vše, co nepotřebujeme. Smazal jsem asi 90% repozitáře a zbylo jen nastavení webpacku aneb základní esence dev stacku. <strong>Stack z tohoto článku je však stále použitelný i pro reálné nasazení</strong>. Není to jen nějaká nevyzkoušená hračka. Chybí v něm ale ukázky návrhového vzoru Flux, server-side rendering, lokalizace a vůbec všechny patterny a techniky. Pokud je chcete prostudovat už dnes, pusťte se do <a href=\\\"https://github.com/steida/este\\\">originálu</a>. Nebo si počkejte na další články.</p>\\n<h2>Webpack<a id=\\\"webpack\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Už jsem o něm básnil v <a href=\\\"nastroje.html\\\">předchozím článku</a>. Pro jeho docenění je nejdříve potřeba pojmenovat zásadní problém, kterému vývojáři webových aplikací čelí. Naše aplikace (zdrojové kódy) jsou distribuovány pomocí pomalého a nespolehlivého protokolu HTTP do vzdáleného prohlížeče. Tam se musí ihned zparsovat, spustit a něco provést. Velikost naší aplikace je tedy velmi limitovaná, pokud nechceme uživatele ztratit nekonečnou bílou stránkou. <strong>Aby vše fungovalo svižně, musíme co nejvíce omezit počet HTTP requestů a minimalizovat jejich velikost.</strong></p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width:334px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/webpack.png\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Webpack\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>Jinými slovy <strong>musíme velmi pečlivě zvážit, co a kdy do prohlížeče posílat a po jakých částech</strong>. U spousty aplikací nám bude stačit to, když všechny naše skripty spojíme do jednoho souboru <code>bundle.js</code>. Ovšem takový soubor může časem nepřijemně nabobtnat. Jak to vyřešit? Každá část (stránka) naší aplikace potřebuje pravděpodobně různé skripty a tak můžeme dle URL adresy posílat speciální menší bundly, kde bude jen to, co daná stránka skutečně potřebuje. Kód, který používají všechny stránky (typicky knihovna jako jQuery či React), pak dáme do  <code>&lt;script src=&quot;common.js&quot;&gt;</code>, který bude všude - využijeme tak cache prohlížeče. <strong>To samé můžeme udělat s CSS</strong>. Obrázky pak můžeme vhodně cacheovat (verzovat) a ty, které mají jen pár kB, rovnou vložit zakódované do HTML jako base64 - ušetříme tak další drahocenné requesty. <strong>To zní jako hodně otravné práce, že?</strong></p>\\n<p>Ano, to je hodně práce! Naštěstí existuje geniální webpack, který tohle vše dokáže vyřešit za nás. Jediné co musíme udělat my je <strong>explicitní uvádění závislostí</strong>. V hantýrce ES6 jde o <code>import</code>, v ES5 pak o <code>require</code>. U našich JS modulů to dělat musíme tak jako tak, ale ta převratná myšlenka webpacku spočívá v tom, že úplně stejným způsobem <strong>budeme uvádět (importovat) i CSS, obrázky, fonty</strong> a vlastně úplně cokoliv co daná stránka / komponenta / balíček potřebuje ke svému životu.</p>\\n<p>Webpack pak projde všechny soubory (importy) a sestaví komplexní graf závislostí. Ještě mu musíme ukázat, kde začít, co ignorovat, čím jednotlivé formáty zpracovat (loadery) a jaký od něho očekáváme výstup (jeden velký bundle, více menších bundlů ...). <strong>Výstup pak bude 100% optimální</strong>. Každá část aplikace dostane &quot;na cestu&quot; jen to co skutečně potřebuje a nic zbytečně navíc. Hurá!</p>\\n<p><strong>Webpack má obsáhlou <a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/docs/\\\">dokumentaci</a></strong>, která je ale trochu nepřehledná. Můžete také nahlédnout do <a href=\\\"https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto\\\">hezkého shrnutí</a> od Pete Hunta. Nejlepší ale je použít již nějaký hotový boilerplate a na něm experimentovat. Webpack je velký a mocný nástroj, který je zároveň i extrémně modulární díky loaderům a pluginům. <strong>Není však úplně snadné ho nastavit</strong>.</p>\\n<h2>Hot module replacement<a id=\\\"hot-module-replacement\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Ještě si dovolím jednu malou kecací odbočku, protože pěvně věřím, že v blízké budoucnosti to bude velká věc! Jde o další skvělou funkci webpacku. Slouží čistě vývojářům během vývoje aplikace. Jde o hot module replacement. <strong>Je to cesta, kterou je možné vyměňovat, přidávat a mazat moduly již v běžící aplikaci. Změny se pak na stránce projeví okamžitě bez reloadu.</strong></p>\\n<p>Proč je to tak převratné? <strong>Ohromně to zrychluje a zpříjemňuje vývoj</strong>. Refresh je nejen pomalý ale hlavně se při něm ztrácí stav aplikace. Například rozepsaný formulář nebo posloupnost kroků, kterou jste se dostali do nějaké skryté části aplikace (nedostupné přes URL).</p>\\n<p>Jak tahle magie funguje? Webpack-dev-server si pomocí socketů povídá s webpack runtime (přiložený bundle k hlavnímu skriptu stránky) a oznámí mu, když uložíte (aktualizujete) nějaký soubor. <strong>Webpack runtime se pak zeptá původního starého modulu, jestli umí zpracovat aktualizaci</strong>, pokud ne, tak jde tato výzva stromem závislostí výše. Pokud se nenajde nikdo, kdo by aktualizaci dokázal provést, tak se udělá klasický refresh. Musíme psát ke každému modulu potenciálně velmi komplikovanou accept metodu?</p>\\n<p class=\\\"pic-container\\\" style=\\\"max-width:334px\\\">\\n  <img src=\\\"\" + require(\"./pics/hotreload.png\") + \"\\\" class=\\\"pic\\\" title=\\\"Hot reload pro React\\\" />\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>To by nikdo nedělal. <strong>Naštěstí pro React komponenty je to možné vcelku snadno generalizovat</strong>. Mají totiž jasně daný life-cycle a rerendrování části DOMu bez ztráty state je jejich základní vlastností. A tak vzniknul <a href=\\\"http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/\\\">react-hot-loader</a>. Pro UI část je hot reload nejvíce užitečný, jelikož právě ji nejčastěji testujeme a právě ona obsahuje stav. Nicméně při jistých konvencích se dá celý flux reimplementovat tak, aby bylo možné hot reload použít pro celou aplikaci, jak ukazuje <a href=\\\"https://github.com/gaearon/redux\\\">redux</a>. Taková aplikace je pak shodou okolností i velmi dobře testovatelná.</p>\\n<p>Dnes představuje hot reload černou magii, která funguje, ale jde z ní respekt. Dovedu si však představit, že <strong>příští rok, už budeme knihovny dělit na ty, které hot reload podporují a ty které nikoliv</strong>. Hackování v JS bude ještě víc zábavné než dnes!</p>\\n<h2>Struktura aplikace<a id=\\\"struktura-aplikace\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">dev<span class=\\\"token operator\\\"

potřebné závislosti se vám tímto nainstalují do <code>node_modules/</code>.</p>\\n<h2>Server<a id=\\\"server\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>I přesto, že <strong>naše aplikace a veškerá její logika může kompletně běžet pouze v prohlížeči, pořád nám jí někdo musí do toho prohlížeče naservírovat</strong>. Potřebujeme server. Pro to úplně nejjednodušší použití potřebujeme od serveru to, aby nám vrátil základní HTML strukturu s prázdným <code>&lt;body /&gt;</code> a naší JS aplikací <code>&lt;script src=&quot;build/bundle.js&quot;&gt;</code>. Dále ještě potřebujeme, aby se ve vývojovém módu nahradil hotový <code>build/bundle.js</code> za webpack-dev-server <code>&lt;script src=&quot;//localhost:8888/build/app.js&quot;&gt;</code>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Takový server může být v PHP, Pythonu, Javě či vašem oblíbeném jazyce XXX</strong>. Asi vás úplně nepřekvapí, že my šáhneme opět po JavaScriptu a to <strong>node.js</strong>. Mít prohlížečovou část, serverovou část a nástroje včetně jejich nastavení v jednom jazyce nabízí řadu výhod. Je snadné sdílet stejný kód (router, validace). Lze jednoduše přepínat mezi produkčním a vývojovým režimem. To jsou takové příjemné bonusy. <strong>Pak se nabízí ale i možnost server-side renderování Reactu, kterou už bez node.js nemáte</strong>. Tu však zatím rozebírat nebudeme.</p>\\n<p>Jelikož se tato série soustředí především na tu prohlížečovou část, tak se samotným nodem moc zabývat prozatím nebudeme. Ostatně existuje už i <a href=\\\"http://www.zdrojak.cz/clanky/javascript-na-serveru-zaciname-s-node-js/\\\">český node.js seriál</a>, i když už trochu zastaralý.</p>\\n<p>Hlavní soubor <code>index.js</code> vypadá takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >require<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'babel/register'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token function\\\" >require<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'./main'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p>Pokud chceme používat Babel v prohlížeči, musíme nejdříve náš kód prohnat Babel kompilátorem a prohlížeči poslat až výsledný JavaScript. V prostředí node.js můžeme udělat to samé. Nicméně díky tomu, že nemusíme řešit spojování modulů, minimalizaci a prohlížeče, tak existují i další možnosti. Například <strong>lze místo node používat <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/#babel-node\\\">babel-node</a></strong>. Pro spuštění serveru pak použijete příkaz <code>babel-node index</code> místo <code>node index</code>. Další a <strong>elegantní možností je výše použitý <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/require/\\\">require hook</a> <code>require(&#39;babel/register&#39;)</code></strong>. Babel se nabinduje na nodí require a bude kompilovat soubory za běhu (počínaje <code>./main.js</code>).</p>\\n<p>Soubor <code>main.js</code> je už zajímavější:</p>\\n<code

Nepotřebujeme už Apache či Nginx, protože node umí obstarat HTTP komunikaci sám. Express je nejpoužívanější node framework, se kterým je hračka napsat například jakékoliv API.</p>\\n<p><strong>Nám stačí pouze jedno pravidlo</strong>. V metodě <code>app.get</code> říkáme, že na jakoukoliv adresu nám má server poslat daný řetězec, který reprezentuje naší prázdnou HTML stránku. Tedy krom adresáře <code>/build</code>, ve kterém budeme mít naše bundly či obrázky.</p>\\n<p>Trošku jsem v úvodu lhal o té jediné React komponentě. Tady je totiž druhá s názvem <code>Html</code>. <strong><code>React.renderToStaticMarkup</code> vrátí DOM v podobě prostého řetězce</strong>. Existuje ještě metoda <code>React.renderToString</code>, která vrací to samé, avšak každý element dostane ještě speciální atribut <code>data-reactid</code>. <strong>To se hodí pro server-side rendering</strong>. Po té co se takováto komponenta vykreslí v prohlížeči, React už bude mít díky idčkům kompletní přehled o struktuře DOMu a může se na ní ihned napojit. To však pro elementy jako <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> či <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> nepotřebujeme, jelikož na ty React už nikdy šahat nebude.</p>\\n<p>Než přejdeme na rozbor naší první reactí komponenty, mrkněme na <code>config.js</code>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >default</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  isProduction<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> process<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>env<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>NODE_ENV <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >===</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'production'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  port<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> process<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>env<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>PORT <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >||</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\" >8000</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  version<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >require<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'../../package'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>version\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p><strong>Režim vyčteme z globální proměnné process.env.NODE_ENV</strong>, jak už je u nodu zvykem.

Následně ho totiž přilepíme k <code>build/bundle.js?v=version</code>, abychom si s každou novou verzí vynutili invalidování prohlížečové cache.

Zbytek je ona prázdná HTML struktura, vložení naší budoucí JS aplikace a také prázdný <code>div</code> s <code>id=&quot;app-root&quot;</code>, do kterého v prohlížeči vyrendrujeme naši Reactí aplikaci. <strong>Nikdy jí nerendrujte přímo do <code>body</code> elementu, jelikož do něj rádi svévolně šahají i různé další knihovny, což pak způsobuje Reactu značný bolehlav</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Server si nyní můžete pustit příkazem:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">node index</code><p>V produkčním režimu pak jako:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">NODE_ENV<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span>production node index</code><p>Nyní si otevřte Chrome a mrkněte na <code>http://localhost:8000</code>. Měli byste tam nalézt velké bíle nic - právě to jsme si totiž zatím vytvořili. Zda jde o dobré nic, zkontrolujte nahlédnutím do zdrojového kódu stránky.</p>\\n<h2>Front-end<a id=\\\"front-end\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p>Naše dnešní aplikace bude triviální. Vytvoříme si jedinou React komponentu, která nám vypíše &quot;Hello world!&quot;. Také do ní přidáme pár obrázků a styly, abychom si ukázali, jak funguje Webpack. Vstupní bod aplikace index.js vypadá takto:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span> from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'react'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Main</span> from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'./main'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >const</span> app <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> document<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >getElementById<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'app-root'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Main</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> app<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span></code><p>V DOMu si vylovíme div, do kterého pak vyrendrujeme naši jedinou hlavní komponentu <code>Main</code>. Děsí vás ty špičaté závorky? Říkáte si, že to není validní JS syntax? Ano, není. <strong>Nicméně Babel dané syntaxi rozumí (JSX) a překládá jí do normálních JS funkcí</strong>. Jediné co musíte pro použití JSX udělat je import Reactu. O JSX bude také článek později.</p>\\n<p>Samotná <code>Main</code> komponenta není o moc složitější:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >React</span> from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'react'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'./main.less'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> imgHello from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'./hello.gif'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >import</span> imgIcon from <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'./icon.png'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >export</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >default</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >class</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >Main</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >extends</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\" >React<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>Component</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"token function\\\" >render<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >return</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>div className<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"hello\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token qualifier\\\" >Hello</span> world<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >!</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>img src<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>imgHello<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> width<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token string\\\" >\\\"300px\\\"</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span>img src<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>imgIcon<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n      <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >&lt;</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >/</span>div<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >></span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>Povšimněte si, že kromě povinného Reactu <strong>importujeme i soubor s LESS</strong> (stylopis pro naši komponentu s className hello) <strong>a dokonce i obrázky</strong>. Potřeba minimalizace a mazání nepoužívaných CSS je asi všem jasná. <strong>Proč se ale zaobírat obrázky, když ty se nahrávají asynchronně a jen když jsou potřeba i bez nějakého webpacku?</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Obrázky menší než např. 8kB můžeme automaticky <strong>enkódovat do base64</strong> a vložit přímo do HTML. Tím ušetříme zbytečný HTTP request.</li>\\n<li><strong>Pojmenování</strong>. Webpack obrázky přejmenuje na jejich hash a přesune do společného <code>/build</code> adresáře. Prohlížeč je tak může cacheovat &quot;navždy&quot;, pokud se změní, tak se změní i jejich název.</li>\\n<li><strong>Lepší struktura a opravdová modularita</strong>. Obrázky totiž můžeme mít přímo u jednotlivých komponent, aniž bychom veřejně odhalovali strukturu naší aplikace. Stejně jako styly a vše ostatní.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Pokud se vám nelíbí představa, že byste museli všechny obrázky uvádět přes import, nezoufejte. Webpack umí poznat a vytáhnout název importu i přímo ze <code>src=&quot;&quot;</code>, když si to nastavíte pomocí <a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html#query\\\">loader query</a>.</p>\\n<p>Pro úplnou přehlednost ještě uvedu obsah souboru <code>main.less</code>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>hello <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  color<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> #ff0000<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  font<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>size<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> 3em<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n\\n  img <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    display<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> block<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >;</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><h2>Nastavení Gulpu<a id=\\\"nastaven-gulpu\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Už jsme hotoví s dnešní aplikací (serverem i front-endem)</strong>. Zbývá však ještě konfigurace a uvedení k životu. Proč máme v projektu Gulp i Webpack zároveň? Je pravda, že Webpack do velké míry dokáže spousty činností Gulpu nahradit a s trochou skriptování v <code>package.json</code> bychom se Gulpu dokázali zbavit úplně. Nicméně bude se nám hodit pro samotné spouštění Webpacku a také ESLintu. ESLint má sice také vlastní loader pro webpack, ale v našem nastavení webpacku budeme potlačovat většinu (výstupů) errorů, aby se nám nerozbíjel (nepřerušoval) hot reloading. Bohužel s tím bychom přišli i o výstup ESLintu.</p>\\n<p>Základem konfigurace Gulpu je <code>gulpfile.js</code>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token comment\\\"

Webpack očekává, že mu prvním parametrem předáme konfiguraci. Tu naši si sestavíme v souboru <code>makeconfig.js</code>. Asi jste všimli, že tu dnes trochu míchám ES5 a ES6 (Babel). Pro konfiguraci samotných build nástrojů je jednodušší použít čistý (starý) JS. Navíc ES5 je subset ES6 (Babelu), takže si stejně musíte zvyknout na obě syntaxe. Samotné zdrojové kódy budou téměř vždy jen v Babelu, občas uvedu (formou záložky) i starší zápis.</p>\\n<p>Konfiguraci si obalíme do funkce, které předáme to, zda chceme verzi pro produkci či vývoj:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">module<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span>exports <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token block-keyword\\\" >function</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span>isDevelopment<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">// ...\\n</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>Konfigurace je jeden velký objekt:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> config <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  cache<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> isDevelopment<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  debug<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> isDevelopment<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  devtool<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> isDevelopment <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >?</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'eval-source-map'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >''</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">// ...\\n</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p>Webpack agresivně <a href=\\\"http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#cache\\\">cacheuje</a> jednotlivé moduly a chunky, což výrazně zlepšuje rychlost inkrementálních buildů.

Pomocí <code>exclude</code> je pak možné vyloučit některé importy, což se hodí pro <code>/node_modules</code>.</p>\\n<p><strong>První loader nám zpracovává obrázky</strong>. Pokud jsou menší než 8kB, tak je převede do base64. Vrátí pak URL adresu obrázku. <strong>Druhý loader se aplikuje na všechny JavaScriptové soubory</strong>. Prožene je babel transformací. Ve vývojovém režimu navíc ještě react hot loaderem, který nám přidá accept metody k React komponentám.</p>\\n<p><strong>Poslední loader pak zpracovává LESS importy</strong>. <code>lessLoaders</code> je zkratkou pro:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\">css<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>loader<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >!</span>autoprefixer<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>loader<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >?</span>browsers<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span>last <span class=\\\"token number\\\" >2</span> version<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >!</span>less<span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >-</span>loader</code><p>Nejdříve projde LESS import LESS transformací, následně autoprefixer-loaderem, který nám přidá prefixy nutné pro poslední 2 verze prohlížečů. <code>Css-loader</code> pak vyřeší importy <code>url(...)</code>. A nakonec <code>style-loader</code>, který nám styly vloží do DOMu.</p>\\n<p>V produkčním režimu aplikujeme na výsledek ještě <strong><code>ExtractTextPlugin</code>, který nám ze všech jednotlivých stylů vytvoří samostatný CSS soubor</strong>. V opačném případě jsou naše styly přímo inlinovány javascriptem, což může být pomalé a problematické u starších prohlížečů. Ovšem pro vývoj je to naopak fajn, bude nám fungovat hot-reload.</p>\\n<p>Webpack nyní ví co zpracovávat a pomocí jakých loaderů (transformací). <strong>Nyní mu ještě zbývá říct, jak má vypadat výstup</strong>:</p>\\n<code class=\\\"codeBlock\\\"><span class=\\\"token keyword\\\" >var</span> config <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >=</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">// ...\\n</span>  output<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> isDevelopment <span class=\\\"token operator\\\" >?</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >.</span><span class=\\\"token function\\\" >join<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >(</span></span>__dirname<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'/build/'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    filename<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'app.js'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    publicPath<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'http://localhost:8888/build/'</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >{</span>\\n    path<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'build/'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    filename<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'app.js'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n    publicPath<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\" >'build/'</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >,</span>\\n  <span class=\\\"token comment\\\" spellcheck=\\\"true\\\">// ...\\n</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\" >}</span></code><p><strong>Naše aplikace je jednoduchá a proto nám stačí jeden výstupní společný bundle</strong>.

Ve vývojovém režimu nám skripty a styly bude servírovat přímo webpack-dev-server, který poběží na <code>http://localhost:8888/</code>.</p>\\n<p>Dále můžeme ještě v konfiguraci specifikovat

Avšak tentokrát je obalen webpack-dev-serverem, což je samostatný node.js server, který se postará o aktualizaci změn (assets během vývoje stahujeme z něj). Musíme jen specifikovat na jaké adrese a portu bude běžet a pak také ignorovat výpisy, kterými jinak mohutně spamuje terminál. <code>gutil.PluginError</code> nám pak odchytí chyby během kompilace a vypíše je do terminálu.</p>\\n<h2>Celý dev-stack<a id=\\\"cel-dev-stack\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>A to je vše!</strong> Celý dev stack najdete v <a href=\\\"https://github.com/tajo/javascript\\\">repozitáři této stránky</a> v adresáři <code>/examples</code>.

Taktéž by měl fungovat hot-reload. Otevřte si konzoli. Ne vždy hot-reload funguje (u změn mimo React komponenty). <strong>V konzoli vám pak webpack napíše, že máte provést ruční reload stránky. Proč ho neděláme automaticky? Protože je to otravné.</strong> V praxi se pak stává, že si nechtíc něco uložíte, udělá se refresh a ztratí se vám stav. Prozkoumejte také tab <code>Elements</code> a mrkněte na to, jak vypadá výsledný DOM ve vývojovém a produkčním režimu.</p>\\n<h2>Závěrem<a id=\\\"z-v-rem\\\">&nbsp;</a></h2><p><strong>Postavili jsme si jednoduchý, ale moderní JS dev-stack</strong>, který splňuje všechna očekávání vytyčená v úvodu. Nabízí nám pohodlný vývojový režim s hot-reloadem a bohatými výpisy (včetně source-map), které nám značně usnadní vývoj. V produkčním režimu nám pak webpack vytvoří maximálně optimalizovaný výstupní bundle s našimi skripty, styly a obrázky. Serverovou část naší aplikace jsme vyřešili v node.js. Základní HTML stránku si lze ale stejně dobře naservírovat i jakoukoliv jinou technologií, třeba Apachem s PHP. <strong>Příště si představíme React a konečně si něco naprogramujeme.</strong></p>\\n\";\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./content/Stack/index.md\n ** module id = 131\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","module.exports = \"<p><strong>Vítejte!</strong> Zde se budou postupně objevovat články zaměřené na vývoj moderních interaktivních webovek, kde hlavní slovo má <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>React</strong> a <strong>Flux</strong>.
